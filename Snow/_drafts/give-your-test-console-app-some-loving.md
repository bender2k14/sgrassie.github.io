You have an application, perhaps its a web site, perhaps its a desktop application, or even a mobile application. You (hopefully) have unit tests, you (hopefully) follow TDD, to a greater or lesser extent. Hopefully your application has a well structured internal API, probably has some external services which you call out to.

You've also with near certainty got a console application which you cobbled together one day to diagnose or test a particularly vexing issue.

It's probably a horrible little throwaway console application which you just haven't gotten around to deleting yet, and seeing as it's there might as well get used to do this and this and this and... it's now an essential development tool.

It's also probably a horrible mess of spaghetti code and arcane command line switches that have to be called in a certain order in order to get it to do anything useful.

It doesn't have to be that way.
