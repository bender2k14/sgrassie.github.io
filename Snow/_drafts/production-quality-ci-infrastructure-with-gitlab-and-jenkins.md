...or, How to practice good development practices on a limited budget.

Let's leave the discussion about what "good" development practices are for another day, as it is a myriad and deep topic, it is suffice for me to say I consider writing unit tests, good source control and a build server to be tantamount to good development practices. 

Again, what is good source control is a myriad and deep topic itself, although we as an industry seem to have mostly standardised on git. Happily, git is free, so it ticks one of our boxes.

What is "production" quality is also a relative term, as what is production quality for me (and the setup I will describe is one I use in a production environment) and my (very) small team might not necessarily be production quality for someone else in a considerably larger organisation (or with a larger deployment).

I think that the setup I describe below is good enough for a lone developer working at home to a small team of developers in a startup or corporate setting. Remember: Some teams of developers work in places were every penny counts, where the budgets are small or nonexistant.

## Hardware

## Gitlab

## Jenkins

## Continuous Integration
