In my career so far as a software developer, I've noted many instances of the [Pareto principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle). You've probably all heard of the famous Microsoft study that showed that fixing 20% of the most reported bugs fixed 80% of the associated errors and crashes in the system.

Here are two that I've noted:

1. 80% of programmers are overweight.
2. 20% of programmers continue to learn and improve themselves.

Pretty broad generalisations I know, but I think it's true. If I were to say "Most developers are overweight and only work 9-5, never on weekends, and never on side projects", would you disagree? 

Scott Hanselman calls these "Dark Matter Developers"; Troy Hunt called them "The Ghosts Who Code".
