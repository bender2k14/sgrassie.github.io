In my career so far as a software developer, I've noted many instances of the [Pareto principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle). For example, you've probably heard of the Microsoft study that showed that fixing 20% of the most reported bugs fixed 80% of the associated errors and crashes in the system.

Here are two that I've noted:

1. 80% of programmers are overweight.
2. 20% of programmers continue to learn and improve themselves.

Pretty broad generalisations I know, but I think it is generally true, although there will definitely be exceptions. If I were to say "Most developers are overweight and only work 9-5, never on weekends, and never on side projects", would you disagree? 

> Incidentily, Scott Hanselman calls these "Dark Matter Developers"; Troy Hunt called them "The Ghosts Who Code".

If you are in the practice of refactoring code when appropriate (and you should be), then I think you should also be in the practice of refactoring yourself. Or to put it another way: Realise that you are imperfect, and strive to improve. In the context of this post and the two examples of the Pareto principle I noted, I intend that to mean:

1. Lose weight and get fit.
2. Learn _more_ about programming, and _practice_ your craft.
