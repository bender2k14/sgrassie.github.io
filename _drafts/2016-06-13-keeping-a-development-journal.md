title: Keeping a development journal

Or, 'how to become a better programmer'.

Since I started work as a programmer, I've always taken notes in meetings, and jotted things down during the day to remember, but these were all usually on an A4 notepad, which I've always used as a daily scratch pad, and until recently I have never kept a proper journal which I could refer back to at a later time.

A chap I have been working with on a project for the last several months has always written stuff down in meetings, or things that happen during the day, such as a particular design descision or some relevant comment from the Product Owner/Customer, in a notebook (it's actually an A5 filofax), which is jokingly reffered to as the "project bible".

I didn't understand the joke until after a few weeks, when I asked a question about some functionality in the application, and my colleague was able to look a back through his notes many months into the past (he's been on the project longer than I have) and could tell me the exact reason the functionality I was questioning had been implemented that way, the date and time of the meeting where this was decided, who was at the meeting and who had come up with various ideas and the reasons this particular solution had been chosen. 

After a few more examples of this, I was intrigued, and during a retrospective I asked how he did it, and could he teach it to me. The simple answer was this: Just write it down.

If you write it down, you are more likely to remember it. There is a large body of evidence that suggests that the simple act of physically writing notes helps aid memory retention.
