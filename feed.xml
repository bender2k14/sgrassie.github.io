&lt;p&gt;For most of the time I've been blogging, I've used Wordpress. It's very good software, but kind of requires
somewhere to host it. Either on your own custom hosting, or wordpress.com. For a long time, I paid for my own
hosting provider. But the times they are a changing, and I'm no longer prepared to pay for my own hosting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Enter snow&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Github provide a way of hosting a website, for free, it's called Github Pages. Using a tool called Jekyll, it is
possible to take a series of Markdown files and generate a static html website from them. The only drawback to Jekyll
is that that it's written in Ruby, it can be a pain to configure on Windows, and I'm primarily a windows kind of guy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's also true that the vast majority of guides/tutorials out there for running a blog with Jekyll assume that you'll
be doing it on either a Mac or a Linux machine. I work entirely on Windows, and there is no way I'm going to try to
configure Ruby on all the machines I use (or might use).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/Sandra/Sandra.Snow"&gt;Sandra.Snow&lt;/a&gt; is written in C#, and uses &lt;a href="https://github.com/nancyFx/Nancy"&gt;Nancyfx&lt;/a&gt; to process the markdown into static html, exactly like Jekyll. I'm
not sure about the name myself, but there you go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the next few posts I'll go over how I switched my blog from a hosted Wordpress to a staticly generated site using Snow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to start learning how to use ReactiveUI to develop a WPF desktop application, and I have experience with building MVVM applications with Prism and Caliburn.Micro, so the challenge for me is learning RxUi's opinions and how to do stuff in an asynchronous fashion. I'm going to assume that anyone reading this has some understanding of WPF, XAML, MVVM and some familiarity with C#.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Baby Steps&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our goal here is simple: Create a basic WPF application, configure ReactiveUI and display a view with a label on it which says "Hello, World!". Not very original, but it should enable us to get a very basic grasp of the library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start a new WPF application, and add ReactiveUI to it via NuGet. Make sure to add ReactiveUI-Xaml to it, as that will allow us to exciting things with WPF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've done a &lt;a title="Custom Structuremap Dependency Resolver for ReactiveUI 5" href="http://temporalcohesion.co.uk/2013/07/04/custom-structuremap-dependency-resolver-for-reactiveui-5/" target="_blank"&gt;little bit messing around in the past&lt;/a&gt; with RxUI, but I've not really put together a full blown app that actually does something, so I've decided to learn how to use it to (for the time being) build a WPF desktop app. I might expand on what I build. We shall see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title="Paul Betts" href="https://twitter.com/paulcbetts" target="_blank"&gt;Paul Betts&lt;/a&gt;, the amazing coding ninja and author of ReactiveUI, will probably be the first to admit that the documentation for ReactiveUI hasn't historically been all that it could be. There are some great example applications already out there, and if you ask a question on Twitter or the ReativeUI mailing list, you will get an answer. There also doesn't seem to be very many people blogging about how to use RxUI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I thought I'd give it a try myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm going to try and blog my way through my learning experience, on a step-by-step basis. I'm going to make mistakes, some of my code will be awful, my WPF UI design is guaranteed to make you vomit, and I might not even use RxUI in the way that you are supposed to. But hopefully any mistakes I make will go towards the learning aspect of this endeavour.&lt;/p&gt;

This is fine in the most part, for most applications. But, when you have some complicated dependencies between objects (ignoring the fact you might be heading towards a constructor over-injection anti-pattern), you may feel you need to use a full IoC container, like Structuremap, to do the heavy work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All we need to do first is implement {csharp}IMutableDependencyResolver{/csharp}, and replace the default implementation in ReactiveUi with our new one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
    public class StructureMapDependencyResolver : IMutableDependencyResolver
    {
        public StructureMapDependencyResolver()
        {
            ObjectFactory.Initialize(init =&amp;gt; init.Scan(scan =&amp;gt;
                          {
                              scan.TheCallingAssembly();
                              scan.LookForRegistries();
                              scan.WithDefaultConventions();
                          }));

        }

        public void Dispose()
        {
        }

        public object GetService(Type serviceType, string contract = null)
        {
            return string.IsNullOrEmpty(contract)
                       ? ObjectFactory.GetInstance(serviceType)
                       : ObjectFactory.GetNamedInstance(serviceType, contract);
        }

        public IEnumerable&amp;lt;object&amp;gt; GetServices(Type serviceType, string contract = null)
        {
            return ObjectFactory.GetAllInstances(serviceType).Cast&amp;lt;object&amp;gt;();
        }

        public void Register(Func&amp;lt;object&amp;gt; factory, Type serviceType, string contract = null)
        {
            ObjectFactory.Configure(x =&amp;gt; x.For(serviceType).Use(factory()));
        }
    }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, make ReactiveUI use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
var resolver = new StructureMapDependencyResolver();
RxApp.InitializeCustomResolver((o, type) =&amp;gt; resolver.Register(() =&amp;gt; o, type));
RxApp.DependencyResolver = resolver;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second line there is very important: ReactiveUi uses the DependecyResolver internally, so if you use your own, you need to initialise it with the default ReactiveUi types, or else The Bad Things� will happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm sure everyone has heard of Vim, but for those who don't know:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Vim is a highly configurable text editor built to enable efficient text editing. It is an improved version of the vi editor distributed with most UNIX systems.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started to use Vim primarily as an affect of using Git as my preferred VCS, as msysgit ships with a version of vim and is configured to use as the default editor when you &lt;em&gt;git commit&lt;/em&gt;, or do various other things. The more I used it the more I started to like it, so I installed it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By default, Vim is a very productive editor. It does have a learning curve, but I don't think it is a steep one. You should be able to get up to speed and become productive fairly quickly. Basic navigation and inserting/removing text is quite simple to get to grips with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have some basic mastery, if you are like me you will quickly want to learn how to customise Vim in order to make it even more useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Procrastination is defined as: &lt;em&gt;�The action of delaying or postponing something.�&lt;/em&gt;� It is something with which I am unfortunately very familiar with. I have suffered from it, or been guilty of it, for as long as I can remember.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook, twitter, read a book, IM a friend, see what films are on the movie channels, do housework, go for a walk, play a video game, re-check email, call my fianc�e, write some code, mindlessly read RSS feeds for the latest up-to-the-second news about the latest iPhone rumours even though I no longer own an iPhone. In short, do anything but that which I have set out to do, which is write a blog post about procrastination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Case in point on how much I procrastinate about certain things: This blog post. It's been almost a year since I last edited it and saved it as a draft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[caption id="attachment_326" align="aligncenter" width="452"]&lt;a href="http://temporalcohesion.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/lastedited.png"&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-326" title="lastedited" src="http://temporalcohesion.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/lastedited.png" alt="Last Edited" width="452" height="53" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I am lazy[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I�m not going to even attempt to write about curing procrastination because I obviously haven't found something which works for me. There are also a myriad of websites and books available on this subject, and it is painfully obvious that I am not the one to be giving advice on how to beat it. I will instead attempt to explore why it is that I do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why do I procrastinate? An easy question to ask, a harder one to answer. Avoiding thinking about the answer to this question by looking through hits on Google leads me to this blog post at Lifehack.org, on &lt;a href="http://www.lifehack.org/articles/productivity/overcome-procrastination-once-and-for-all.html"&gt;overcoming productivity&lt;/a&gt;. It contains a number of basic reasons why people procrastinate, and I can identify with all of them, although some more than others. That it is a basic list implies that there are more complex reasons why people procrastinate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After reflecting on this question for some time, I think that I can confidently say that when I embark on a new project, the initial excitement and enthusiasm for it carry me through, but once that wears off, my interest in it starts to wane. In the case of a coding project, the problem domain is what interests me, the technical challenge of designing and implementing a solution to the problem; once that problem is solved, the interest wanes, and the finer details fail to get polished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is in itself fairly interesting, because as a programmer, I do tend to be a little OCD over certain things. Obviously this doesn�t extend to finishing projects. Take for example the Github API library I�ve been �working� on for far too long. Obsessing over tiny implementation details of the best way to handle authentication and access to methods on the API which require authorization has been my primary method of procrastination on this particular project. Now that I�ve pretty much resolved that particular issue, the detail of actually fleshing out all the methods for the API �seems like a boring chore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This also extends to blogging, clearly evidenced by this blog itself with the almost year long hiatus between updates. Then there is another blog, on a wholly unrelated subject, which I started about 4 years ago and haven�t updated in three-and-a-half. I�ll get the blogging bug, write a few posts, get bored with it, and stop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really do need to put a stop to this, as it is becoming a big problem for me, as well as making me look like an idiot. Maybe this whole cathartic post might help me in some small way.&lt;/p&gt;
