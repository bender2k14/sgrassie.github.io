&lt;p&gt;When you have a git repository which has a few submodules (.e.g. a vim dotfiles repo), you may find that you'll notice one day that they all point to ancient commits in their parent repositories. Consequently, you want to update them, to get the new shiny things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do so is fairly straightforward (from your parent repository):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;git submodule update --recursive --remote
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This tells git that you want to update the submodules to the latest commit on the submodules remote tracking branch (&lt;code&gt;--remote&lt;/code&gt;) and to do it recursively (&lt;code&gt;--recursive&lt;/code&gt;) on all of the submodules (and their submodules if any).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then if you check the &lt;code&gt;git status&lt;/code&gt; you should see something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
M:\vimfiles [master +0 ~9 -0]&gt; git status
# On branch master
# Changes not staged for commit:
#   (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to update what will be committed)
#   (use "git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;..." to discard changes in working directory)
#
#       modified:   bundle/ctrlp (new commits)
#       modified:   bundle/delimitmate (new commits)
#       modified:   bundle/nerdtree (new commits)
#       modified:   bundle/tagbar (new commits)
#       modified:   bundle/vim-jade (new commits)
#       modified:   bundle/vim-javascript.git (new commits)
#       modified:   bundle/vim-pathogen (new commits)
#       modified:   bundle/vim-powerline (new commits)
#       modified:   bundle/vim-ps1 (new commits)
#
no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may find this confusing, as you have just updated all the submodules to the latest commit. Why are are there new commits? If you do a &lt;code&gt;diff&lt;/code&gt; on one of them, you'll see something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
M:\vimfiles [master +0 ~9 -0]&gt; git diff bundle/ctrlp
diff --git a/bundle/ctrlp b/bundle/ctrlp

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which makes sense, because you have asked git to update the submodule(s) to the latest commit, so it is therefore unsuprising that your repo now knows that its submodules have changed. You need to tell your repository to actually use the latest commit of the submodules, and then commit everything:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
git submodule update
git commit -am "Updated submodules to latest"
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope that helps someone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For most of the time I've been blogging, I've used Wordpress. It's very good software, but kind of requires
somewhere to host it. Either on your own custom hosting, or wordpress.com. For a long time, I paid for my own
hosting provider. But the times they are a changing, and I'm no longer prepared to pay for my own hosting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Enter snow&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Github provide a way of hosting a website, for free, it's called Github Pages. Using a tool called Jekyll, it is
possible to take a series of Markdown files and generate a static html website from them. The only drawback to Jekyll
is that that it's written in Ruby, it can be a pain to configure on Windows, and I'm primarily a windows kind of guy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's also true that the vast majority of guides/tutorials out there for running a blog with Jekyll assume that you'll
be doing it on either a Mac or a Linux machine. I work entirely on Windows, and there is no way I'm going to try to
configure Ruby on all the machines I use (or might use).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/Sandra/Sandra.Snow"&gt;Sandra.Snow&lt;/a&gt; is written in C#, and uses &lt;a href="https://github.com/nancyFx/Nancy"&gt;Nancyfx&lt;/a&gt; to process the markdown into static html, exactly like Jekyll. I'm
not sure about the name myself, but there you go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the next few posts I'll go over how I switched my blog from a hosted Wordpress to a staticly generated site using Snow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to start learning how to use ReactiveUI to develop a WPF desktop application, and I have experience with building MVVM applications with Prism and Caliburn.Micro, so the challenge for me is learning RxUi's opinions and how to do stuff in an asynchronous fashion. I'm going to assume that anyone reading this has some understanding of WPF, XAML, MVVM and some familiarity with C#.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Baby Steps&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our goal here is simple: Create a basic WPF application, configure ReactiveUI and display a view with a label on it which says "Hello, World!". Not very original, but it should enable us to get a very basic grasp of the library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start a new WPF application, and add ReactiveUI to it via NuGet. Make sure to add ReactiveUI-Xaml to it, as that will allow us to exciting things with WPF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've done a &lt;a title="Custom Structuremap Dependency Resolver for ReactiveUI 5" href="http://temporalcohesion.co.uk/2013/07/04/custom-structuremap-dependency-resolver-for-reactiveui-5/" target="_blank"&gt;little bit messing around in the past&lt;/a&gt; with RxUI, but I've not really put together a full blown app that actually does something, so I've decided to learn how to use it to (for the time being) build a WPF desktop app. I might expand on what I build. We shall see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title="Paul Betts" href="https://twitter.com/paulcbetts" target="_blank"&gt;Paul Betts&lt;/a&gt;, the amazing coding ninja and author of ReactiveUI, will probably be the first to admit that the documentation for ReactiveUI hasn't historically been all that it could be. There are some great example applications already out there, and if you ask a question on Twitter or the ReativeUI mailing list, you will get an answer. There also doesn't seem to be very many people blogging about how to use RxUI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I thought I'd give it a try myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm going to try and blog my way through my learning experience, on a step-by-step basis. I'm going to make mistakes, some of my code will be awful, my WPF UI design is guaranteed to make you vomit, and I might not even use RxUI in the way that you are supposed to.

This is fine in the most part, for most applications. But, when you have some complicated dependencies between objects (ignoring the fact you might be heading towards a constructor over-injection anti-pattern), you may feel you need to use a full IoC container, like Structuremap, to do the heavy work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All we need to do first is implement {csharp}IMutableDependencyResolver{/csharp}, and replace the default implementation in ReactiveUi with our new one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
    public class StructureMapDependencyResolver : IMutableDependencyResolver
    {
        public StructureMapDependencyResolver()
        {
            ObjectFactory.Initialize(init =&amp;gt; init.Scan(scan =&amp;gt;
                          {
                              scan.TheCallingAssembly();
                              scan.LookForRegistries();
                              scan.WithDefaultConventions();
                          }));

        }

        public void Dispose()
        {
        }

        public object GetService(Type serviceType, string contract = null)
        {
            return string.IsNullOrEmpty(contract)
                       ? ObjectFactory.GetInstance(serviceType)
                       : ObjectFactory.GetNamedInstance(serviceType, contract);
        }

        public IEnumerable&amp;lt;object&amp;gt; GetServices(Type serviceType, string contract = null)
        {
            return ObjectFactory.GetAllInstances(serviceType).Cast&amp;lt;object&amp;gt;();
        }

        public void Register(Func&amp;lt;object&amp;gt; factory, Type serviceType, string contract = null)
        {
            ObjectFactory.Configure(x =&amp;gt; x.For(serviceType).Use(factory()));
        }
    }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, make ReactiveUI use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
var resolver = new StructureMapDependencyResolver();
RxApp.InitializeCustomResolver((o, type) =&amp;gt; resolver.Register(() =&amp;gt; o, type));
RxApp.DependencyResolver = resolver;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second line there is very important: ReactiveUi uses the DependecyResolver internally, so if you use your own, you need to initialise it with the default ReactiveUi types, or else The Bad Things� will happen.&lt;/p&gt;

However these days with the proliferation of web development technologies, there are just too many tools to have running on your machine. I work in Windows, and having PHP, Ruby, Django, Node, Grails and whatever else all on my system path starts getting a little unwieldy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter virtualisation to the rescue. With VirtualBox and a Linux distro you can build yourself a self contained development environment with all your favourite tools. With a little work, you can customise it just how you like, including getting Git running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm sure everyone has heard of Vim, but for those who don't know:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Vim is a highly configurable text editor built to enable efficient text editing. It is an improved version of the vi editor distributed with most UNIX systems.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started to use Vim primarily as an affect of using Git as my preferred VCS, as msysgit ships with a version of vim and is configured to use as the default editor when you &lt;em&gt;git commit&lt;/em&gt;, or do various other things. The more I used it the more I started to like it, so I installed it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By default, Vim is a very productive editor. It does have a learning curve, but I don't think it is a steep one. You should be able to get up to speed and become productive fairly quickly. Basic navigation and inserting/removing text is quite simple to get to grips with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have some basic mastery, if you are like me you will quickly want to learn how to customise Vim in order to make it even more useful.&lt;/p&gt;
