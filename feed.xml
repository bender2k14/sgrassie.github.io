The escaped html in the feed generator from the markdown by Snow wasn't getting rendered in the aggregator correctly. After a little digging it was apparant to me that the &lt;code&gt;RssResponse&lt;/code&gt; in Snow was not correctly setting it's content type.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could have left it there, or submitted a small patch to fix the issue (I still will), but I noticed that the feed it generates isn't a pure atom feed, so I basically copied the relevant classes (changing 'rss' to 'atom') in the class names, and did a little configuration, and swapped over the feed to use atom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though I know that the atom feed validates, this post is in part a test to see what happens...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you have a git repository which has a few submodules (.e.g. a vim dotfiles repo), you may find that you'll notice one day that they all point to ancient commits in their parent repositories. Consequently, you want to update them, to get the new shiny things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do so is fairly straightforward (from your parent repository):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;git submodule update --recursive --remote
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This tells git that you want to update the submodules to the latest commit on the submodules remote tracking branch (&lt;code&gt;--remote&lt;/code&gt;) and to do it recursively (&lt;code&gt;--recursive&lt;/code&gt;) on all of the submodules (and their submodules if any).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then if you check the &lt;code&gt;git status&lt;/code&gt; you should see something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
M:\vimfiles [master +0 ~9 -0]&gt; git status
# On branch master
# Changes not staged for commit:
#   (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to update what will be committed)
#   (use "git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;..." to discard changes in working directory)
#
#       modified:   bundle/ctrlp (new commits)
#       modified:   bundle/delimitmate (new commits)
#       modified:   bundle/nerdtree (new commits)
#       modified:   bundle/tagbar (new commits)
#       modified:   bundle/vim-jade (new commits)
#       modified:   bundle/vim-javascript.git (new commits)
#       modified:   bundle/vim-pathogen (new commits)
#       modified:   bundle/vim-powerline (new commits)
#       modified:   bundle/vim-ps1 (new commits)
#
no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may find this confusing, as you have just updated all the submodules to the latest commit. Why are are there new commits? If you do a &lt;code&gt;diff&lt;/code&gt; on one of them, you'll see something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
M:\vimfiles [master +0 ~9 -0]&gt; git diff bundle/ctrlp
diff --git a/bundle/ctrlp b/bundle/ctrlp
index be5842a..b5d3fe6 160000

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which makes sense, because you have asked git to update the submodule(s) to the latest commit, so it is therefore unsuprising that your repo now knows that its submodules have changed. You need to tell your repository to actually use the latest commit of the submodules, and then commit everything:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
git submodule update
git commit -am "Updated submodules to latest"
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope that helps someone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For most of the time I've been blogging, I've used Wordpress. It's very good software, but kind of requires
somewhere to host it. Either on your own custom hosting, or wordpress.com. For a long time, I paid for my own
hosting provider. But the times they are a changing, and I'm no longer prepared to pay for my own hosting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Enter snow&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Github provide a way of hosting a website, for free, it's called Github Pages. Using a tool called Jekyll, it is
possible to take a series of Markdown files and generate a static html website from them. The only drawback to Jekyll
is that that it's written in Ruby, it can be a pain to configure on Windows, and I'm primarily a windows kind of guy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's also true that the vast majority of guides/tutorials out there for running a blog with Jekyll assume that you'll
be doing it on either a Mac or a Linux machine. I work entirely on Windows, and there is no way I'm going to try to
configure Ruby on all the machines I use (or might use).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/Sandra/Sandra.Snow"&gt;Sandra.Snow&lt;/a&gt; is written in C#, and uses &lt;a href="https://github.com/nancyFx/Nancy"&gt;Nancyfx&lt;/a&gt; to process the markdown into static html, exactly like Jekyll. I'm
not sure about the name myself, but there you go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to start learning how to use ReactiveUI to develop a WPF desktop application, and I have experience with building MVVM applications with Prism and Caliburn.Micro, so the challenge for me is learning RxUi's opinions and how to do stuff in an asynchronous fashion. I'm going to assume that anyone reading this has some understanding of WPF, XAML, MVVM and some familiarity with C#.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Baby Steps&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our goal here is simple: Create a basic WPF application, configure ReactiveUI and display a view with a label on it which says "Hello, World!". Not very original, but it should enable us to get a very basic grasp of the library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start a new WPF application, and add ReactiveUI to it via NuGet. Make sure to add ReactiveUI-Xaml to it, as that will allow us to exciting things with WPF.&lt;/p&gt;

This is fine in the most part, for most applications. But, when you have some complicated dependencies between objects (ignoring the fact you might be heading towards a constructor over-injection anti-pattern), you may feel you need to use a full IoC container, like Structuremap, to do the heavy work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All we need to do first is implement {csharp}IMutableDependencyResolver{/csharp}, and replace the default implementation in ReactiveUi with our new one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
    public class StructureMapDependencyResolver : IMutableDependencyResolver
    {
        public StructureMapDependencyResolver()
        {
            ObjectFactory.Initialize(init =&amp;gt; init.Scan(scan =&amp;gt;
                          {
                              scan.TheCallingAssembly();
                              scan.LookForRegistries();
                              scan.WithDefaultConventions();
                          }));

        }

        public void Dispose()
        {
        }

        public object GetService(Type serviceType, string contract = null)
        {
            return string.IsNullOrEmpty(contract)
                       ? ObjectFactory.GetInstance(serviceType)
                       : ObjectFactory.GetNamedInstance(serviceType, contract);
        }

        public IEnumerable&amp;lt;object&amp;gt; GetServices(Type serviceType, string contract = null)
        {
            return ObjectFactory.GetAllInstances(serviceType).Cast&amp;lt;object&amp;gt;();
        }

        public void Register(Func&amp;lt;object&amp;gt; factory, Type serviceType, string contract = null)
        {
            ObjectFactory.Configure(x =&amp;gt; x.For(serviceType).Use(factory()));
        }
    }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, make ReactiveUI use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
var resolver = new StructureMapDependencyResolver();
RxApp.InitializeCustomResolver((o, type) =&amp;gt; resolver.Register(() =&amp;gt; o, type));
RxApp.DependencyResolver = resolver;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second line there is very important: ReactiveUi uses the DependecyResolver internally, so if you use your own, you need to initialise it with the default ReactiveUi types, or else The Bad Things� will happen.&lt;/p&gt;

                          {
                              scan.TheCallingAssembly();
                              scan.LookForRegistries();
                              scan.WithDefaultConventions();
                          }));

        }

        public void Dispose()
        {
        }

        public object GetService(Type serviceType, string contract = null)
        {
            return string.IsNullOrEmpty(contract)
                       ? ObjectFactory.GetInstance(serviceType)
                       : ObjectFactory.GetNamedInstance(serviceType, contract);
        }

        public IEnumerable&amp;lt;object&amp;gt; GetServices(Type serviceType, string contract = null)
        {
            return ObjectFactory.GetAllInstances(serviceType).Cast&amp;lt;object&amp;gt;();
        }

        public void Register(Func&amp;lt;object&amp;gt; factory, Type serviceType, string contract = null)
        {
            ObjectFactory.Configure(x =&amp;gt; x.For(serviceType).Use(factory()));
        }
    }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, make ReactiveUI use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
var resolver = new StructureMapDependencyResolver();
RxApp.InitializeCustomResolver((o, type) =&amp;gt; resolver.Register(() =&amp;gt; o, type));
RxApp.DependencyResolver = resolver;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second line there is very important: ReactiveUi uses the DependecyResolver internally, so if you use your own, you need to initialise it with the default ReactiveUi types, or else The Bad Things� will happen.&lt;/p&gt;

However these days with the proliferation of web development technologies, there are just too many tools to have running on your machine. I work in Windows, and having PHP, Ruby, Django, Node, Grails and whatever else all on my system path starts getting a little unwieldy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter virtualisation to the rescue. With VirtualBox and a Linux distro you can build yourself a self contained development environment with all your favourite tools. With a little work, you can customise it just how you like, including getting Git running.&lt;/p&gt;
