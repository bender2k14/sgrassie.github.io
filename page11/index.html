<p>It's true, New Years resolutions are pass�. Every year, you look at what is wrong in your life and triumphantly decide that you are going to resolve these problems by issuing a bold and sweeping set of statements, or edicts.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Lose weight</li>
    <li>Stop smoking</li>
    <li>Get fit</li>
</ul>

<p>These are what you want to achieve, chasing that ever elusive dream of making your life better. Can you? Can a simple list of statements help you achieve these goals? I'm not so sure. For some people I'm sure that they don't even have to write them down, those super motivated people who seem to exude success.</p>

<p>I used to do this, on scraps of easily lost paper, "Stuart's New Year's Resolutions!" it would say, with a list of two or three word ambition's for the year. Lost by February. For the last few years I haven't even bothered with writing them down, I'd just mouth off to anyone who would listen, "I'm gonna do this, and that, this year, you wait and see".</p>

<p>Which funnily enough, didn't get me very far with achieving very much. That said, 2007 was a year I'll never forget, for a number of reasons (not all of which I want to go into here), and it has led me to believe even more than I did, that it is all well and good to strole through life without a care, thinking everything is fine and dandy. Because it is not. Doing that will get you stuck, trapped in a rut that you can't get out of, never having made anything of your life.</p>

<p>Thankfully, I'm pretty certain that I'm not in a rut. Trust me, I've been there and I know what it is like.</p>

<p>So what to do instead of making 'New Year's Resolutions'? It's simple: Set goals. "But", I hear you cry, "a goal IS a resolution?!" Which in this sense I suppose they are, however there is a crucial difference. A goal set's out what you want to do and how you are going to achieve it.</p>

<p>The above list could be re-written like so:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Lose weight by eating healthily and exercising more to get fit.</li>
    <li>Stop smoking by using patches and will power, giving up completely by Easter.</li>
    <li>Get fit, by joining a gym, running and cycling and lose 2 stone by Easter</li>
</ul>

<p>These aren't my goals for this year... Ok, I don't smoke, but the other two count. I'm not revealing my other goals... yet. I have several though, and I intend to get stuck in and achieve them.</p>

<p>Something I discovered fairly quickly when coding (cake)PHP in eclipse, is that, like code completion in Models, unless you do a little extra configuration, code completion in Views won't work.</p>

<p>If however, you make a slight modification to the Views index.ctp, and create a HtmlHelper() yourself, then you get code completion on $html-&gt;, and access to all the methods, and the rendered view isn't affected at all.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre lang="PHP">
<?php
if(false)

{

$html = new HtmlHelper();

}

?></pre>

<p>I found the answer to this after posting on the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/cake-php/browse_thread/thread/04b94b593714b394/9c71e02157bcaacd#9c71e02157bcaacd" target="_blank">CakePHP google group</a>, and getting a good answer from a user. Top Stuff</p>

<p>After chatting with one of my friends who is earning loads of cash doing php web development, I've decided that I'm going  relearn PHP, not because I want a change of career, I'm happy where I am, but because... I just want to.</p>

<p>Because I've become a bit of a snob, used to having intellisense and and all the wonders that IDE's such as Visual Studio and Borland Delphi provide, I wanted to do my PHP development in a proper IDE. Since I've been doing a lot of Java at work - enter <a href="http://www.eclipse.org" title="The Eclipse IDE" target="_blank">Eclipse</a>, and the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/pdt/" title="Eclipse PDT plugins" target="_blank">Eclipse PHP</a> plugins.</p>

<p>As you can see in the screenshot above (which shows some code from the <a href="http://www.cakephp.org" title="A Nice Piece of Cake!">cakePHP</a> 15 minute blog tutorial), the plugins provide an awesome amount of functionality, such as:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Code folding</li>
    <li>Intellisense/code completion</li>
    <li>Syntax highlighting/colouring</li>
    <li>API Documentation tool-tips</li>
</ul>

<p>All this functionality is pretty easy to set up, and there is a pretty good guide available in <a href="http://bakery.cakephp.org/articles/view/setting-up-eclipse-to-work-with-cake" target="_blank">The Bakery</a> that covers just about everything you need to know to get going. There was a little bit of configuration that I did that was slightly different to that guide:</p>

<p>Firstly, I don't believe that you need to set up cakePHP as a project in order to get the code completion to work. If you expand your project, and right click on your project include paths, you should be on the PHP Include path dialog, in the projects properties. If you add an external folder, and browse to the cake core directory (for me: C:xampphtdocscake), and click ok, you should now have code completion and all the associated awesomeness in your project, with the added benefit that for any different projects in your workspace, you can set up different versions of cakePHP or (I haven't tried this though) a different framework such as <a href="http://www.symfony-project.com">Symfony</a>.</p>

<p>Secondly, for code completion in Models, you just have to do something like this:</p>

<pre lang="PHP">
class PostsController extends AppController{var $name = 'Posts';

/**

* @var Post

*/

var $Post;

...code

}</pre>

<p>Hope this is of use to somebody :)</p>

<p>The other day, I watched the Linus Torvalds <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XpnKHJAok8" title="Linus Torvald's tech talk on git" target="_blank">tech talk</a> at google, which he gave on source control systems. It was mostly (biased) about how great <a href="http://git.or.cz/" target="_blank">git</a> is, and how other source control systems, with a few exceptions, have mostly got it wrong. This all got me thinking about source control systems I have used.</p>

<p>Now, I use Microsoft's <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/aa718670.aspx" target="_blank">Visual Sourcesafe</a> every day at work, and let me tell you: it's shit. The only (slightly) good thing about it, is the integration with VS.Net 2005, which is unsurprisingly very good. I know that I'm not really offering much of an argument as to exactly why VSS is a horrible pile of dog turd, but anyone whose ever used will understand.</p>

<p>Anyway. I digress.</p>

<p>I never really thought that the creator of Linux would be such an engaging and humorous speaker - aren't stereotypes fun - but he was. It kind of got me thinking about source control. I've used CVS and SVN before on a few open source projects I've contributed to, or just wanted to get the latest source for.</p>

<p>I've mostly only ever used CVS or SVN, arguably the two most popular version control systems currently in use today. Better than VSS in every way, but still lacking quite a lot. For instance it's a well known fact that merges in CVS are a horrible nightmare, and that merges in SVN aren't much better. Thankfully I've never had to do them. And I know enough about VSS to know that merges are just generally avoided. Like you'd try to avoid an STI.</p>

<p>So, over the weekend (you'll notice how much of my free time is "over the weekend") I decided to have a little play with with some distributed version control systems. Now, I'm not going to go on about what one of those is, nor how great they are, as you can use google for that. But suffice to say that they are fucking ace.</p>

<p>I had to discount Git pretty much straight away - for various reasons (development being primary) I've installed Winxp back onto my laptop, and I'm playing with Windows Server 2003 R2 on my dev server, so I road tested Mercurial and Bazaar-ng. I spent a great deal of time researching the two systems, and ultimately decided to go with bazaar.  I've not really got down to much development with bazaar yet, but early results look promising.</p>

<p>After about 10 minutes fannying around, I had Bazaar installed, and a shared repository set-up on my dev server, which I checked out and branched a few times on my laptop (3 branches: dev, testing and stable). With bazaar I can make as many dev branches as I like, for each crazy idea I have, and easily merge them upstream as they become awesomely realised ideas, or deleted and forgotten about like a red-headed step-child.</p>

<p>This is all on my laptop, and I can easily push my working code onto my desktop if I want to code on there, or back onto my server for safe keeping, or publish it on a website. Or any combination of those. I'll post some more about Bazaar after I've been using it for a while.</p>

<p>I spent much of the weekend fucking around installing linux on my laptop. I like linux, it's free, and there's loads of cool software available. I tried:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Ubuntu 7.04</li>
    <li>Fedora 7</li>
    <li>opensuse 10.2</li>
</ul>

<p>The actual installations themselves went pretty painlessly, just pop the disk in, and boot from it, and click install. These modern installations are pretty cool, not like the good old days of installing redhat/slackware/debian from multiple floppy discs.</p>

<p>The only problem I had was getting my 3Com 3crwe62092b wireless lan pcmcia card to work. What a pain in the fucking arse that was. Ubuntu Feistey Fawn 7.04 wouldn't even detect it, and Fedora 7 detected it, but it wouldn't work.</p>

<p>Needless to say, I was getting frustrated at this point, and I downloaded opensuse 10.2, specifically a 44mb network install disk. And fuck me, it asked me for wlan details, and connected to my wireless network first time. Ace.</p>

<p>But - and theres always a but - when it rebooted there was a problem. The wireless stopped working. I managed to get the rest of the installation completed using a wired connection. After some further googling, it turns out that the solution to my problem was to download the atmel-firmware, and copy the *.bin's to /lib/firmware. Rebooted and the wireless came up straightway. Hurrah!</p>

<p>I suspect that armed with this new knowledge I should be able to install Ubuntu/Fedora and get the card to work on them, but I'm liking opensuse enough that I'm not sure I can be bothered to reinstall a different distribution again.</p>

<p>This is also the reason that linux isn't ready for the desktop yet - the average person wouldn't spend time googling and recompiling kernels and installing different distributions just to get wireless working on their laptop. It should just work, with no effort. This is the advantage that windows has over linux, the driver support is significantly better.</p>

<p>But it works for me, so fuck em.</p>
