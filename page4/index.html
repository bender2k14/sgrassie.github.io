<blockquote>Never put off until tomorrow what you can do the day after tomorrow. - Mark Twain</blockquote>

<p>Procrastination is defined as: <em>�The action of delaying or postponing something.�</em>� It is something with which I am unfortunately very familiar with. I have suffered from it, or been guilty of it, for as long as I can remember.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>Facebook, twitter, read a book, IM a friend, see what films are on the movie channels, do housework, go for a walk, play a video game, re-check email, call my fianc�e, write some code, mindlessly read RSS feeds for the latest up-to-the-second news about the latest iPhone rumours even though I no longer own an iPhone. In short, do anything but that which I have set out to do, which is write a blog post about procrastination.</p>

<p>Case in point on how much I procrastinate about certain things: This blog post. It's been almost a year since I last edited it and saved it as a draft.</p>

<p>[caption id="attachment_326" align="aligncenter" width="452"]<a href="http://temporalcohesion.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/lastedited.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-326" title="lastedited" src="http://temporalcohesion.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/lastedited.png" alt="Last Edited" width="452" height="53" /></a> I am lazy[/caption]</p>

<p>I�m not going to even attempt to write about curing procrastination because I obviously haven't found something which works for me. There are also a myriad of websites and books available on this subject, and it is painfully obvious that I am not the one to be giving advice on how to beat it. I will instead attempt to explore why it is that I do it.</p>

<p>So why do I procrastinate? An easy question to ask, a harder one to answer. Avoiding thinking about the answer to this question by looking through hits on Google leads me to this blog post at Lifehack.org, on <a href="http://www.lifehack.org/articles/productivity/overcome-procrastination-once-and-for-all.html">overcoming productivity</a>. It contains a number of basic reasons why people procrastinate, and I can identify with all of them, although some more than others. That it is a basic list implies that there are more complex reasons why people procrastinate.</p>

<p>After reflecting on this question for some time, I think that I can confidently say that when I embark on a new project, the initial excitement and enthusiasm for it carry me through, but once that wears off, my interest in it starts to wane. In the case of a coding project, the problem domain is what interests me, the technical challenge of designing and implementing a solution to the problem; once that problem is solved, the interest wanes, and the finer details fail to get polished.</p>

<p>This is in itself fairly interesting, because as a programmer, I do tend to be a little OCD over certain things. Obviously this doesn�t extend to finishing projects. Take for example the Github API library I�ve been �working� on for far too long. Obsessing over tiny implementation details of the best way to handle authentication and access to methods on the API which require authorization has been my primary method of procrastination on this particular project. Now that I�ve pretty much resolved that particular issue, the detail of actually fleshing out all the methods for the API �seems like a boring chore.</p>

<p>This also extends to blogging, clearly evidenced by this blog itself with the almost year long hiatus between updates. Then there is another blog, on a wholly unrelated subject, which I started about 4 years ago and haven�t updated in three-and-a-half. I�ll get the blogging bug, write a few posts, get bored with it, and stop.</p>

<p>I really do need to put a stop to this, as it is becoming a big problem for me, as well as making me look like an idiot. Maybe this whole cathartic post might help me in some small way.</p>

The ugly truth is that I�ve barely worked on it, literally in months. I did a little bit recently, and I had one or two good ideas about certain things, but, I do have to be honest with myself. I am not not admitting defeat, I know that I am capable enough to finish it. </p>  <p>I�m simply bored with it.</p>  <p>Also, someone has <a href="https://github.com/erikzaadi/GithubSharp" target="_blank">already beaten me to it</a>, and is writing something that is actually far superior to what I�d managed to push out. In my defence, I haven�t done very much anyway, so anything that is fairly substantial is going to look better by default.</p>  <p>So, I�m going to knock it on the head. I�ll leave the code, such as it is, up on Github.</p></p>

<p>Whilst writing some blog posts about the authentication which I've been implementing, I've come to the realization, almost as an after thought, that even though I've still not got a lot of the main Github API implemented, the way I've envisioned the API working, from a user point of view, is sort of a bit shit.</p>

<pre class="brush:applescript">var userApi = new UserApi();
var user = userApi.GetUser("example");</pre>

<p>Pretty straightforward, right? What about the as yet unwritten GistApi?</p>

<pre class="brush:csharp">var gistApi = new GistApi();
var gist = gistApi.GetGist(...);</pre>

<p>Again, pretty straightforward. But I see a pattern forming. What am I going to do when it comes to the RepositoryApi?</p>

<pre class="brush:csharp">var reposApi = new RepositoryApi();
var repo = reposApi.GetRepository(...);</pre>

<p>Well, that is starting to look pretty fucking stupid. I've caught myself doing it with other methods as well. I simply cannot believe I've let myself be so stupid. At least there is not that much implemented where I'll have to refactor loads of shit.</p>

	   </ul>
   </div>
            
   
   
<h1>The Basics</h1>

<p>The typical way that you'd make a request with RestSharp:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Create a RestRequest</li>
    <li>Create a RestClient</li>
    <li>Execute the request with the client</li>
    <li>Do something with the response.</li>
</ol>

<p>It's at the point that you get the client object that you may wish to add authentication. For example with a REST API such as Githubs, certain methods behave differently if the request is authenticated or not, so being able to magically turn on authentication is desirable.</p>

<p>To authenticate a request with RestSharp, it is a simple case of creating a RestRequest, RestClient and an IAuthenticator instance for the authenticating mechanism you want to use. For example:</p>

<pre class="brush:csharp">var client = new RestClient
             {
                 BaseUrl ="https://api.github.com",
                 Authenticator = new HttpBasicAuthenticator(username, password)
             };</pre>

<p>This is pretty straightforward and standard RestSharp usage. You may have a class to encapsulate this functionality, with a method which returns the RestClient instance, probably in a base class in order to inherit this common functionality in other classes.</p>

<pre class="brush:csharp">public abstract class BaseApi
{
    RestClient GetRestClient()
    {
        ...
    }
}</pre>

<h1>Options</h1>

<p>There are several methods which we can use to add authentication dynamically to the RestClient instance, ranging from the trivial to the more involved.</p>

<p>The trivial solution is to add the IAuthenticator as a parameter to the method, which is then assigned to the RestClient when it is created. Easy. Also fairly easy is just make it abstract or virtual and override it in an inheriting class, although this breaks SRP.</p>

<p>Alternatively, we can implement the Decorator pattern, and introduce the authentication in a class which is solely responsible for handing it. I'm not going to go into this in too much detail, there is a wealth of information on implementing this pattern already available on the web. Using a Decorator is valid in a lot of situations, particularly when re-factoring someone else's mess, as you can adhere to the same interface and not risk breaking some important business function. In other cases, it is better to intercept.</p>

<h1>Interception</h1>

<p>A pattern which lends itself to this is called Proxy, and if you spend any time with Google and search terms like "c# proxy pattern" you'll quickly end up finding a lot of information about implementing it. You'll also find interesting stuff about Castle.DynamicProxy, and you may quickly realise this is an excellent way of adding the ability to dynamically intercept a method to add additional functionality on the fly. I've implemented an interceptor in the Github API library, with the core magic being:</p>

<pre class="brush:csharp">public void Intercept(IInvocation invocation)
{
    invocation.Proceed(); // let the RestClient be instantiated as normal.
    var restClient = (RestClient)invocation.ReturnValue;
    restClient.Authenticator = _authenticator; // add the authenticator
    invocation.ReturnValue = restClient;
 }</pre>

<p>I then wrap the interception up in a static class, which is a technique I <a href="http://geekswithblogs.net/BlackRabbitCoder/archive/2010/05/06/c-why-decorate-when-you-can-intercept.aspx">saw on another website</a>, which I then wrap in a extension method which with a little bit of generics hangs off API classes in a fluent manner.</p>

<pre class="brush:csharp">var api = new UserApi(GitHubUrl).WithAuthentication(authenticator);</pre>

<p>I feel like it is the best way to do this sort of thing, and I will certainly starting using more of it, where necessary, in all my projects.</p>

   </div>
            
   
   
<p>With v3 of the Github REST API, calling a certain methods when unauthenticated will return a limited set of information, and when authenticated will return extra information. One of the things I wanted to do was to make it easy, in a fluent manner, to add authentication to a request. For example:</p>

<pre class="brush:csharp">var a = new UserApi();
var user = a.WithAuthentication(authenticationObject).GetUser("example");
var b = new UserApi().WithAuthentication(authenticationObject);
user = b.GetUser("example");</pre>

<p>Thus making it possible to instantiate an API object without having to authenticate, then when authorization for an action is required, the authentication can be provided. When that actually happens is, I think , something that is an implementation detail best left to future consumers of the library. Assuming I get it finished.</p>

<p>I got bogged down over the course of several months in trying to wrap my head around a clean way of implementing this. Initially I had a good inheritance from an Api base class to the UserApi class - this is sensible, the base Api class does after all contain methods which are going to be common to different classes, such as GistsApi, RepositoriesApi etc.</p>

<p>Then things got a little screwy.</p>

<p>At that point I had the following implemented:</p>

<pre class="brush:csharp">var github = new Github(authenticator);
var user = gitHub.User.GetUser("example");
user.Authenticated.AddEmail("example@example.com");</pre>

<p>Which doesn't seem all that bad. The User property on the Github object was an instance of UserApi. When the example User is fetched, the UserApi object was added an internal instance on the User object. Then the Authenticated property on the User object returned a new AuthenticatedUser, which acted as a wrapper to the internal UserApi instance where the actual AddEmail was hidden as internal.</p>

<p>Needless to say, I knew something was wrong with that, and I spent far too long in coming up with a more elegant solution.</p>

<p>In my second stab at things, I tried to implement Decorator to solve this problem, that is, decorate the UserApi with the additional functionality to add the authentication. The trouble is that the way I wanted to implement the pattern wouldn't have lent itself exceedingly well to having specific functionality for the different parts of the api.</p>

<p>Then I thought to myself, wouldn't it be great if I could intercept the method in the base class which gets the RestClient and add the authentication to it on the fly. A little Googling taught me that this is idealised as the Proxy pattern, from which it was but a short leap to the <a title="The Castle Project" href="http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CCUQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.castleproject.org%2F&amp;rct=j&amp;q=castle%20project&amp;ei=5hqHTu3bCKnH0QXsgPXvDw&amp;usg=AFQjCNEUSLcxGcsnLhC_LQOSuUFdNZLizw&amp;cad=rja" target="_blank">Castle project </a>and <a title="Castle DynamicProxy" href="http://www.castleproject.org/dynamicproxy/index.html" target="_blank">DynamicProxy</a>.</p>
