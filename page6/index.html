<p>With v3 of the Github REST API, calling a certain methods when unauthenticated will return a limited set of information, and when authenticated will return extra information. One of the things I wanted to do was to make it easy, in a fluent manner, to add authentication to a request. For example:</p>

<pre class="brush:csharp">var a = new UserApi();
var user = a.WithAuthentication(authenticationObject).GetUser("example");
var b = new UserApi().WithAuthentication(authenticationObject);
user = b.GetUser("example");</pre>

<p>Thus making it possible to instantiate an API object without having to authenticate, then when authorization for an action is required, the authentication can be provided. When that actually happens is, I think , something that is an implementation detail best left to future consumers of the library. Assuming I get it finished.</p>

<p>I got bogged down over the course of several months in trying to wrap my head around a clean way of implementing this. Initially I had a good inheritance from an Api base class to the UserApi class - this is sensible, the base Api class does after all contain methods which are going to be common to different classes, such as GistsApi, RepositoriesApi etc.</p>

<p>Then things got a little screwy.</p>

<p>At that point I had the following implemented:</p>

<pre class="brush:csharp">var github = new Github(authenticator);
var user = gitHub.User.GetUser("example");
user.Authenticated.AddEmail("example@example.com");</pre>

<p>Which doesn't seem all that bad. The User property on the Github object was an instance of UserApi. When the example User is fetched, the UserApi object was added an internal instance on the User object. Then the Authenticated property on the User object returned a new AuthenticatedUser, which acted as a wrapper to the internal UserApi instance where the actual AddEmail was hidden as internal.</p>

<p>Needless to say, I knew something was wrong with that, and I spent far too long in coming up with a more elegant solution.</p>

<p>In my second stab at things, I tried to implement Decorator to solve this problem, that is, decorate the UserApi with the additional functionality to add the authentication. The trouble is that the way I wanted to implement the pattern wouldn't have lent itself exceedingly well to having specific functionality for the different parts of the api.</p>

<p>Then I thought to myself, wouldn't it be great if I could intercept the method in the base class which gets the RestClient and add the authentication to it on the fly. A little Googling taught me that this is idealised as the Proxy pattern, from which it was but a short leap to the <a title="The Castle Project" href="http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CCUQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.castleproject.org%2F&amp;rct=j&amp;q=castle%20project&amp;ei=5hqHTu3bCKnH0QXsgPXvDw&amp;usg=AFQjCNEUSLcxGcsnLhC_LQOSuUFdNZLizw&amp;cad=rja" target="_blank">Castle project </a>and <a title="Castle DynamicProxy" href="http://www.castleproject.org/dynamicproxy/index.html" target="_blank">DynamicProxy</a>.</p>

<p>Despite many months of not posting anything on this blog (OK, nearly a year) I am returning with another post about my on/off project to write a C# library to access the Github REST API. Much like my blogging schedule, which can arguably be said to be none-existent, my pet-project�s suffer from the same cruel lack of... habit.</p>

<p>To recap this particular project, you may like to browse some of the earlier posts on it, wherein I grandly proclaim my intent to write a �Github API in C#�. Which I should really have finished by now. As you will have no doubt realised, I do suffer from a certain amount of laziness. That is a subject for another blog post. To my shame, I can tell you that the amount of Github�s REST API which I�m covering is minimal, limited to a subset of the available User related commands.</p>

<p>Moving swiftly along, with no trace of irony.</p>

<p>In the months since the start of this project, Github has release v3 of their REST API, which contains many updated and/or new methods to access the whole plethora of the functionality available on Github. Indeed, they have even gone as far as to release a desktop client for Mac�s, and for all I know are working on a Windows version, which would then render this effort of mine (because that�s what I�ve always intended) redundant.</p>

<p>So, despite not blogging about it, and despite going months between commits, I have been working on the library. The RestSharp git sub-module is gone (I mean, who likes sub-modules anyway?) in favour of the NuGet package. The authentication has been reworked slightly (still no OAuth yet) and the API is a little more fluenty.</p>

<p>Of course, it still doesn�t actually let you do very much, I mean even after a year, you still can�t perform all of the actions available to a user. This is terrible, and speaks volumes about me, as a person. Procrastination is my enemy.</p>

<p>A lot of people who work, don't like their job. It's a fact. If you were at a party and you asked people if they like the job they get paid to do, the response would be largely negative. That you are reading this, on this blog, indicates that you are probably a programmer. Then, on the assumption that you are in some capacity employed as a programmer, I can say to you that you are a lucky person.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>It is simple, really: A large percentage of the programmers I have met,� have worked with or follow on Twitter absolutely love to write code, whether it is for a website, a desktop application of some kind or they are just monkeying around with something. They love it! I love doing it. A number of my friends love doing it. And the best thing?</p>

<p>We get paid to do it!</p>

<p>Don't get me wrong here, I know plenty of people who turn up at 9am and go home at 5pm and wouldn't even consider writing anything for themselves or doing any open source work. For them, it's like a factory job, albeit a (generally) much better paid one. Jeff Atwood (love him or loathe him) has a great post about these sorts of programmers titled <a title="There are Two Types of Programmers - codinghorror.com" href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/11/the-two-types-of-programmers.html" target="_blank">"There are Two Types of Programmers"</a>. Even though these programmers might not code in their spare time, I'd still say that 99% still like their job.</p>

<p>I'll place myself firmly in that 20% block of programmers though. I wouldn't say I was a rock star programmer, I'm certainly not bad, but I do always want to constantly improve myself and my ability. As the old saying, "Practice makes perfect". I definitely love my job. Maybe I could do without some of the meetings and the office politics which comes from working in a large company, but still, I love what I do.</p>

<p>I get paid to do what I love doing; I consider myself lucky.</p>

<p>Once we make a request to Github.com with <a title="RestSharp.org" href="http://restsharp.org/" target="_blank">RestSharp</a>, we get a response, and RestSharp gives us a <a title="RestResponse class in RestSharp on github.com" href="http://github.com/johnsheehan/RestSharp/blob/master/RestSharp/RestResponse.cs" target="_blank">RestResponse</a> object, with which we can do something with the content. The content will be in the format that we specified when we made the request, either JSON, XML or YAML.</p>

<p>Oh crap, complicated string parsing...</p>

<p>RestSharp to the rescue! We don't have to worry about parsing the response content, because RestSharp can do it for us.</p>

<p>What we need to do, is model the response content into a POCO (Plain Old Clr Object):</p>

<pre class="brush: csharp">public class User
{
    public virtual int Id { get; set; }
    public virtual string Login { get; set; }
    public virtual string Name { get; set;}

    ...
}</pre>

<p>Note that in this <a title="User class in the csharp-github-api project" href="http://github.com/sgrassie/csharp-github-api/blob/master/csharp-github-api/Models/User.cs" target="_blank">User</a> class, I've made the properties virtual, this is not necessary for RestSharp to function correctly, it's more habit on my part from working with NHibernate; however it does mean you can reuse the same models with NHibernate (if you wanted to do something like store the response in a database, for example).</p>

<p>Then we need to modify our client such that when we execute the request, we instruct RestSharp to construct an instance of the User object. Create the client in the usual way and also create the request in the usual way. The magic is in how the client executes the request:</p>

<pre class="brush: csharp">var request = new RestRequest
                  {
                      Resource = string.Format("/user/show/{0}", username),
                      RootElement = "user"
                  };

var response = client.Execute&lt;User&gt;(request);

var user = response.Data;</pre>

<p>As you can see, the Execute method has a generic overload. Internally, RestSharp detects that because we have used this overload, we want to deserialise the response content into an object of the given type, and it performs the deserialisation and constructs an instance of the object. The way that it does this is by looking at the Content-Type header in the response, and it uses the correct deserialiser depending upon the Content-Type. You can see more detail about this on <a href="http://github.com/johnsheehan/RestSharp/blob/master/RestSharp/RestClient.cs" target="_blank">RestSharp's Github project pages</a>.</p>

<p>It is really easy to work with the response from your REST request with RestSharp, you can access the raw string content of the response, or deserialise it into a POCO - it's up to you.</p>
