<p><a title="Link to earlier blog post." href="http://temporalcohesion.co.uk/2008/08/29/source-control-using-dropbox/" target="_self">Some time ago</a>, I wrote about using <a title="Link to dropbox.com" href="https://www.dropbox.com/" target="_blank">Dropbox </a>as a version control system. I now realise how naive� and short-sighted that thought was. At the time, it was my belief that a dropbox account could be suitable for maintaining version history, and after a fashion, it can be, because using the web client to view your files, you can see previous versions of� the files in your dropbox.</p>

<p>However, there are problems with this approach. Consider that you've changed several files, but then you realise that the changes you have made are not good enough, or just don't work. With svn, or vss (<em>vomit</em>), you can undo-checkout to get the previous version back, with dropbox you can roll back to the previous version - one file at a time. There is no branching, no merging, no tagging. Nothing like a traditional SCM tool should have.</p>

<p>Dropbox is after all, essentially just a folder that is backed up "to the cloud". If we use the right tool, we can take advantage of this properly.</p>

<h1>Enter Git</h1>

<p>What is <a title="Git SCM" href="http://git-scm.com/" target="_blank">Git</a>? Well, surely you must have at least heard of Git by now? If not, I refer you to the <a title="Wikipedia article about git" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)" target="_blank">wikipedia page</a> about Git. Ok? You're back?</p>

<p>The key aspect of Git which we can take advantage of is essentially the very nature of Git itself. Every Git clone is a full-repository, containing the full commit  history and full revision tracking capability for the project, and it does not rely on network access nor a central server.</p>

<p>Basically, the idea is that you initialise an empty, bare repository inside your dropbox folder, and then somewhere else on your filesystem, perhaps a development folder where you store all your projects, you clone the repo from dropbox, and do all your work on that clone. Then when you call 'git push origin master', your changes are pushed into the dropbox repo, ready to be synced up on other computers you use.</p>

<blockquote>Note: This is not a substitue for having a proper hosted Git repository, such as a project on Github, or somewhere else. However, it useful if you are working on something you aren't ready to put into the public domain, or you haven't yet decided to purchase an account on a private repository provider.</blockquote>

<h1>Setup</h1>

<p>Setting it up is fairly simple, but, I am going to assume that you have Dropbox and a dropbox account, Git and (if you are on Windows) GitExtensions, correctly installed already.</p>

<blockquote>Note: I have only tested this on Windows 7, but I wouldn't expect it to not work on any other system. As always YMMV.</blockquote>

<p>First, create a folder in your dropbox folder to house your projects, e.g. C:UsersStuartDocumentsMy Dropboxprojects or just store it in the root of your Dropbox, it's upto you. Don't forget to include quotes around any path that has a space in, or else it won't work.</p>

<p>[sourcecode language="bash"]</p>

<p>Stuart@LAPTOP ~/Documents/My Dropbox/projects
$ mkdir example</p>

<p>Stuart@LAPTOP ~/Documents/My Dropbox/projects
$ cd example</p>

<p>Stuart@LAPTOP ~/Documents/My Dropboxprojects/example
$ mkdir .git</p>

<p>Stuart@LAPTOP ~/Documents/My Dropbox/projects/example
$ cd .git/</p>

<p>Stuart@LAPTOP ~/Documents/My Dropbox/projects/example/example.git
$ git init --bare
Initialized empty Git repository in c:/Users/Stuart/Documents/My Dropbox/projects/example
/example.git/</p>

<p>[/sourcecode]</p>

<p>Then, in your development folder clone that repo.</p>

<p>[sourcecode language="bash"]
Stuart@LAPTOP /c/development/examples
$ git clone -v &quot;C:/Users/Stuart/Documents/My Dropbox/projects/example/.git&quot;
Initialized empty Git repository in c:/development/examples/example/.git/</p>

<p>Stuart@LAPTOP /c/development/examples
$ cd example/</p>

<p>Stuart@LAPTOP /c/development/examples/example (master)
$ touch example.txt</p>

<p>Stuart@STUART-LAPTOP /c/development/examples/example (master)
$ git add example.txt</p>

<p>Stuart@LAPTOP /c/development/examples/example (master)
$ git commit -m &quot;Added example file to initial commit&quot;

<p>Dropbox will sync the files into the cloud. On your other computer, the git repo will sync, then you can clone it, and find that you have all your history for your project as you would expect.</p>

<h4>Update:</h4>

<p>I've written some more about what I've learned whilst working on my plugin manager here: <a href="http://temporalcohesion.co.uk/2010/03/17/even-more-on-the-generic-plugin-manager/" target="_self">http://temporalcohesion.co.uk/2010/03/17/even-more-on-the-generic-plugin-manager/</a></p>

<p>A few months ago <a title="Writing a generic plugin manager" href="http://temporalcohesion.co.uk/2009/05/25/writing-a-generic-plugin-manager-in-c/" target="_self">I wrote about</a> writing a generic plugin loader/manager in C#, where I offered links to several articles and referenced a rather excellent book about C# which I had used to base my plugin loader on. I hadn't really given it much thought since then, but according to Google Analytic's, it's one of the most hit posts on my blog. Recently I had a request to release the source code.</p>

<p>Now when I first wrote that post, I was hesitant to include any code, and I still am - not because I think there is something new and unique with what I've done - but, rather that what I have written is not terribly difficult to write. I do not mean to sound snobbish or arrogant at all, I'm just telling you how it is, all I've done is to do a bit of reflection on assemblies in a folder, and load instances of certain interfaces.</p>

<p>Anyway...</p>

<p>The scenario is that you want to provide a way for for 3rd parties to be able to add additional functionality to your application at run time. We need to provide a common way for 3rd parties to be able to register their new functionality into our application, in order that the user can take advantage of the exciting new feature being added to the application.</p>

<p>Straight away, you should be thinking to yourself: Interface!</p>

<pre class="lang:csharp decode:1 " >

public interface IPlugin
 {
 /// &amp;lt;summary&amp;gt;
 /// Does what ever It is.
 /// &amp;lt;/summary&amp;gt;
 void Do(Action it);
 }

</pre>

<p>Anyone who now wants to create a plugin for our application must implement our IPlugin interface, as it defines the contract to which our application is bound to, in order to recognise and load plugins. Thus any assembly, that has a class which implements IPlugin is considered by our application to be a plugin which is capable of offering additional functionality.</p>

<p>We can now attempt to load our plugins. We need to have a class which can scan a folder for assemblies, scan those assemblies for types which implement IPlugin, and then create instances of them which our application can use. Loading the assemblies is easy:</p>

<pre class="lang:csharp decode:1 " >
public class PluginLoader&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;
{
 private IList&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; pluginsList = new List&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;();
 ...
}

...

public virtual IList&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; LoadPlugins()
 {
 foreach (string file in Directory.GetFiles(this.pluginFolderPath, &amp;quot;*.dll&amp;quot;, SearchOption.AllDirectories))
 {
 Assembly assembly = Assembly.LoadFile(file);
 this.LoadObjects(assembly);
 }

 return this.pluginsList;
 }
</pre>

<p>We create a generic class, so we can use it with any type of plugin, and not just ones which implement IPlugin, then it's just simple directory recursion to load all the files in the specified folder which have a file extension of .dll. The real magic happens in the LoadObjects() method.</p>

<pre class="lang:csharp decode:1 " >
var types = from t in assembly.GetTypes()
 where t.IsClass &amp;amp;&amp;amp;
 (t.GetInterface(typeof(T).Name) != null)
 select t;

 foreach (Type t in types)
 {
 T plugin = (T)assembly.CreateInstance(t.FullName, true);
 this.pluginsList.Add(plugin);
 }
</pre>

<p>Using LINQ, we extract all the types from the assembly which are classes, which implement the interface which is a typeof(T) - T being the type we specified when we instantiated the class. You could just as easily here specify the type should inherit from some other type, and you could also check to see if a class has some assembly level attribute.</p>

<p>Why would you want to do that? Well, we can use an assembly level attribute to decorate the plugin class with meta-data about the plugin, such as the author, a short description, the name of the plugin, and it's version.</p>

<pre class="lang:csharp decode:1 " >
public virtual KeyValuePair&amp;lt;string, List&amp;lt;KeyValuePair&amp;lt;string, string&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; GetPluginInformation(Type type)
 {
 var attributeInfo = from pa in type.GetCustomAttributes(false)
 where (pa.GetType() == typeof(PluginAttribute))
 select pa;

 foreach (PluginAttribute p in attributeInfo)
 {
 data.Add(new KeyValuePair&amp;lt;string, string&amp;gt;(&amp;quot;Author&amp;quot;, p.Author));
 data.Add(new KeyValuePair&amp;lt;string, string&amp;gt;(&amp;quot;Description&amp;quot;, p.Description));
 data.Add(new KeyValuePair&amp;lt;string, string&amp;gt;(&amp;quot;Name&amp;quot;, p.Name));
 name = p.Name;
 data.Add(new KeyValuePair&amp;lt;string, string&amp;gt;(&amp;quot;Type&amp;quot;, p.Type.ToString()));
 data.Add(new KeyValuePair&amp;lt;string, string&amp;gt;(&amp;quot;Version&amp;quot;, p.Version));
 }

 this.attributeInformation = new KeyValuePair&amp;lt;string, List&amp;lt;KeyValuePair&amp;lt;string, string&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;(name, data);

 return this.attributeInformation;
 }
</pre>

<p>Or you could create a struct to use as a DTO for the plugin meta-data, it's up to you.</p>

<p>I've removed all the comments and exception handling from the code I've posted purely just to save space, you'd really want to include that - especially the exception handling. But that's really all there is to it, you might want to have a property to access the actual plugin list, or return it from a LoadPlugins method, it's up to you.</p>

<p>You'll notice I've made the methods virtual, you may want to use this class as a base class in another class. For instance I've got an additional class which inherits from my plugin loader class which does specific tasks for a particular type of plugin, and another which does different tasks for a different type of plugin.</p>

<p>I have recently started using psake to do some build automation at work, and I've found that there is not a great deal of information about how to write a build script using psake available on the internet. It isn't all that amazingly difficult if truth be told, however there are a couple of 'gotchas', and I would like to share what I have learned in the hopes that it benefits someone.</p>

<p>If you have not heard of it, <a title="psake project on Google Code" href="http://code.google.com/p/psake/" target="_blank">psake</a> is a"...build automation tool written in PowerShell", started by <a title="James Kovacs' blog" href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/james.kovacs/default.aspx" target="_blank">James Kovacs</a>. With it, you can write build scripts, with which you can automate the build and deployment of your .NET project. Recently the version <a title="psake 2.00 release annoucement" href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/james.kovacs/archive/2009/10/14/releasing-psake-v1-00-amp-psake-v2-00.aspx">1.00 and 2.0<strong> </strong>0 version were released</a>. Why two versions? Well, the 1.00 version is primarily for PowerShell 1.0, but psake 1.00 is being "retired". This article assumes the reader is using psake 2.01 and PowerShell 2.0.</p>

<p>A quick note here, I should point out the primary example I based my first build script on is <a title="Ayende Rahien Rhino Mocks build script" href="http://ayende.com/Blog/archive/2009/08/30/on-psake.aspx" target="_blank">Ayende Rahien's build script for Rhino Mocks</a>.</p>

<h2>Our first psake build script</h2>

<p>First, I have to make two assumptions:</p>

<ol>
    <li>I have to assume that you have PowerShell installed, if you are running Vista/Windows 7 then it's installed by default, if you are on XP, then it is a manual install.</li>
    <li>You have installed the psake module into Powershell - see the release announcement linked to above for details on how to do this.</li>
</ol>

<p>[caption id="attachment_120" align="alignleft" width="137" caption="Example solution"]<a href="http://temporalcohesion.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/psake_example_solution.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-120    " title="psake_example_solution" src="http://temporalcohesion.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/psake_example_solution.png" alt="Example solution" width="137" height="161" /></a>[/caption]</p>

<p>With those assumptions out of the way, we are going to write a build script to automate the building of a simple C# solution, containing a Windows Forms application, and two class library assemblies.</p>

<p>Hopefully this should be simple enough to easily follow along with what is happening in the build script, but complex enough that you can see how sophisticated your build scripts can be.</p>

<p>You can see that I have already taken the liberty of adding an extra file to the solution, "build.ps1", this is our build script, with which we can command psake to do great things for us.</p>

<p>With our solution setup, we can now write our first build script:</p>

<pre class="lang:powershell decode:1 " >
properties {
 $base_dir = Resolve-Path .
 $sln_file = &amp;quot;$base_dirWindowsFormsApplication.sln&amp;quot;
}

Task default -depends Compile

Task Compile {
 msbuild &amp;quot;$sln_file&amp;quot;
}
</pre>

<p>Open a command prompt into the directory containing the .sln file, which is where your build.ps1 script
should be, and run this command: invoke-psake .build.ps1 -taskList Compile</p>

<p>[caption id="attachment_123" align="aligncenter" width="300" caption="psake Compile task output"]<a href="http://temporalcohesion.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/psake_Compile.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-123" title="psake_Compile" src="http://temporalcohesion.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/psake_Compile-300x296.png" alt="psake Compile task output" width="300" height="296" /></a>[/caption]</p>

<p>You should receive some output to the console window like the above.What the script does is to work out where on the file system the script is running, and gets the path to that folder, and builds the path to the specified solution file, and runs msbuild, passing the full path to the solution file as a parameter.</p>

<p>The script as it is has some drawbacks though. In it's current form, msbuild will only build the default configuration of the solution. What if we want to build a Debug version, or a Release version, or some other configuration we've created? Additionally, it doesn't let us specify a directory to put the built binaries, they just get put in the default locations as specified in the projects contained in the solution - what if we want to put them in a custom location?</p>

<p>If we modify our build script slightly, we can introduce this functionality. Firstly, we need to specify some additional properties:</p>

<pre class="lang:powershell decode:1 " >
properties {
 $base_dir = Resolve-Path .
 $build_dir = &amp;quot;$base_dirbuild&amp;quot;
 $sln_file = &amp;quot;$base_dirWindowsFormsApplication.sln&amp;quot;
 $debug_dir = &amp;quot;$build_dirDebug\&amp;quot;
 $release_dir = &amp;quot;$build_dirRelease\&amp;quot;;
}
</pre>

<p>Notice the double backslash, msbuild requires a trailing slash when paths are specified, and it seems to require the additional backslash as well, or else it doesn't work. With those additional properties in place, we can introduce two new tasks to our build script:</p>

<pre class="lang:powershell decode:1 " >
Task Clean {
 remove-item -force -recurse $debug_dir -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
 remove-item -force -recurse $release_dir -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
}

Task Init -depends Clean {
 new-item $debug_dir -itemType directory
 new-item $release_dir -itemType directory
}
</pre>

<p>Powershell's easy to read syntax should make it easy to follow with what is happening now. In the Clean task, we forcefully and recursively remove any files and the folder from the specified path, and if there are any errors then they are not displayed. Now that we know that those folders are going to be cleaned and created, we can create two further tasks, where we can create Debug and Release versions of our solution:</p>

<pre class="lang:powershell decode:1 " >
Task Debug -depends Init {
 msbuild $sln_file &amp;quot;/nologo&amp;quot; &amp;quot;/t:Rebuild&amp;quot; &amp;quot;/p:Configuration=Debug&amp;quot; &amp;quot;/p:OutDir=&amp;quot;&amp;quot;$debug_dir&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;
}

Task Release -depends Init {
 msbuild $sln_file &amp;quot;/nologo&amp;quot; &amp;quot;/t:Rebuild&amp;quot; &amp;quot;/p:Configuration=Release&amp;quot; &amp;quot;/p:OutDir=&amp;quot;&amp;quot;$release_dir&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;
</pre>

<p>Again, the syntax here is relatively straightforward to follow along with, we execute msbuild, passing it the solution file to build, specify not to show the logo (suppressing the output of "copyright microsoft msbuild etc), tell it to execute the rebuild target and to build the Debug configuration, copying the output to the specified debug directory. Notice that that there are no spaces in the paramters that we pass to msbuild. For example, if we passed the parameters like this: "/p:Configuration=Release /p:OutDir=""$release_dir""", then it would fail and we would get a msbuild parse error saying it was invalid.</p>

<p>[caption id="attachment_129" align="alignleft" width="196" caption="Build script output for Debug task"]<a href="http://temporalcohesion.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/psake_example_debug.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-129" title="psake_example_debug" src="http://temporalcohesion.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/psake_example_debug-196x300.png" alt="Build script output for Debug task" width="196" height="300" /></a>[/caption]</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>In a relatively short amount of code, less than 30 lines, we have accomplished quite a lot. We can now issue the command: invoke-psake .build.ps1 -taskList Debug, and psake will automatically clean the output folders, do a full rebuild of the Debug configuration and copy the output to a custom location on our filesystem. What's more, the build script we have written is small, compact, easy to read, easy to maintain and easy to build/extend upon in the future.</p>

<p>As this is getting a bit long already, I'm going to cut things short here, however, there are some additional things that you can do as part of the build script that are very nice, such as automatically versioning the assembly before you do the full build. If you take a look at <a title="Ayende Rahien Rhino Mocks build script" href="http://ayende.com/Blog/archive/2009/08/30/on-psake.aspx" target="_blank">Ayende Rahien's example</a> from Rhino Mocks, that is covered there.</p>

<p>Also in the new version of psake, there are pre and post conditions and actions that you can add onto your tasks, although I haven't had the opportunity to use them yet. I'll try to cover those in a future blog post though.</p>

<p>Love him or hate him, several years ago, Jeff Atwood (of Codinghorror.com infamy and the really rather awesome StackOverflow.com) <a title="Recommended reading on codinghorror.com" href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000020.html" target="_blank">posted on his blog</a> a recommended reading list for developers. He has since become a sort of mini internet programming celebrity. Since imitation is the greatest form of flattery, I present to you my own list of recommended reading.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Code Complete 2nd Edition</strong>, by <a title="SteveMcConnell.com" href="http://www.stevemcconnell.com/" target="_blank">Steve McConnel</a> should be recommended reading on software engineering degrees at Universities the world over. It is a classic book about the software industry. McConnel makes the distinction between average programmers, who are happy to go through the motions of churning out (usually terrible) code and collecting their wages; and above average programmers, who continually seek to improve their base knowledge, actively improving their skills, who write solid, well designed and easily maintainable code. I think this was the book that really changed my mindset about being a programmer, about being proud of the work I do and the programs I write and maintain.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Working Effectively with Legacy Code</strong>, by <a title="MichaelFeathers.com" href="http://www.michaelfeathers.com/" target="_blank">Michael Feathers</a> is another classic book, and another which I believe should be recommended reading on all University software engineering degrees. The reason I would recommended this book to any aspiring developer is that, more than likely they are going to be working with legacy code. I would say that 95% of the code I work with on a daily basis is legacy code, although that figure is slowly improving, thanks in a large part to the skills and knowledge I've gained from this book.� Feathers' defines legacy code as that which does not have unit tests. I would also add that most legacy code is often poorly designed, with no comments and is usually incredibly difficult to maintain. The book is split into three parts, the first part being about how you can bring about change in your legacy code base (and legacy developers!); the second part is like an FAQ, which links techniques together in a way to address common problems; the third part is a reference of the different dependency breaking techniques that can be employed to get your legacy code under test and under control.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>The Art of Unit Testing</strong>, by <a title="ISerializable - Roy Osherove's Blog" href="http://weblogs.asp.net/ROsherove/" target="_blank">Roy Osherove</a>, is an excellent book, full of practical advice about unit testing. The book covers everything, from why you want to unit test your code, to how you can unit test code. Even if, as I had, you have written unit tests before, then you can still learn something from this book. Indeed there were several patterns on how to approach particular problems that I'd not even considered before. Also, I had never really gotten my head around using a mock object framework as part of my unit tests, but this book explains and demonstrates in a clear and concise manner, exactly how you can leverage your mock object framework of choice for your benefit. One minor criticism that I have though, is that I feel there is a certain element of bias toward <a title="Typemock Isolator, mock object framework" href="http://learn.typemock.com/" target="_blank">Typemock Isolator</a> - Osherove is a chief architect at Typemock.</p>

<p><strong>Holub on Patterns</strong>, by <a title="Holub.com" href="http://www.holub.com/" target="_blank">Allen Holub</a>, is another excellent book, about software design.� Design patterns offer an excellent way of not re-inventing the wheel, and Holub offers an entertaining and insightful tour of the majority of the <a title="The Famous Gang of Four book" href="href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0201633612?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tempocohes-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=0201633612&quot;" target="_blank">Gang of Four</a> patterns, and offers real world scenarios in which you would use them. The book is very opinionated, but this is not a bad thing, indeed it is refreshing to read as Holub is obviously very passionate about the subject. It certainly opened my eyes into the world of design patterns, as I'm one of these who finds concrete, interesting examples an excellent tool for learning, and I've always found the Gang of Four book rather dry.</p>

<p><strong>C# In Depth</strong>, by <a title="Jon Skeet's Coding Blog" href="http://msmvps.com/blogs/jon_skeet/default.aspx" target="_blank">Jon Skeet</a> is an excellent book about the C# programming language. If you want to understand something about C#, and I mean really, truly understand why the language does what it does, then I suggest that you read this book. The book is clear and straightforward, with excellent examples. Honestly if most of the people posting C# questions on stackoverflow.com read this book, then I suspect the number of questions would stop increasing at the current rate.</p>
