<p>I've <a title="Writing a generic plugin manager in C# @ Temporal Cohesion" href="http://temporalcohesion.co.uk/2009/05/25/writing-a-generic-plugin-manager-in-c/" target="_self">written </a><a title="More on the generic plugin manager" href="http://temporalcohesion.co.uk/2009/11/02/more-on-the-generic-plugin-manager/" target="_self">previously</a> about writing your own generic plugin manager/framework.</p>

<p>I believe that this is a worthwhile exercise for the beginning programmer, because it firstly teaches you a lot about reflection, and secondly teaches you the advantages that proper use of interfaces can bring to your code. Thirdly it can also teach you to think about how your API might be used by someone else when they write a plugin for your program. In short I think it's a great exercise.</p>

<p>While writing and using my own plugin framework has been a great learning experience for me, I've found that I have outgrown it's usefulness to me. What made me see this was when I started to think about and begin implementing a way for me to use the framework as a <a title="Dependency Injection on Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection" target="_blank">IoC/Dependency Injection</a> tool. This led me off on some Googling and I found <a title="Funq DI container on Codeplex" href="http://funq.codeplex.com/" target="_blank">Funq</a>, and the the <a href="http://www.clariusconsulting.net/blogs/kzu/archive/2009/02/02/116399.aspx" target="_blank">associated screencasts by Cazzulino</a>.</p>

<p>This got me to thinking about <a title="Don't Repeat Yourself on Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself" target="_blank">DRY</a>. Don't Repeat Yourself can just as easily mean Don't Repeat Work Other People Have Already Done (If You Don't Have To), but DRWOPHADIYDHT doesn't sound/look nice as an acronym. Perhaps a better way to express that sentiment is "lazyDRY", or "The re-use of prexisting libraries and code can save you a lot of time, and which effort you can put into your application at a higher level."</p>

<p>Or in other words, it is foolish to ignore the work that other people have done, unless you have a compelling reason to do so. If you really want to write your own IoC/DI container, then great, knock yourself out. No one is going to stop you.</p>

<p>I'm lazy though. Nanos gigantium humeris insidentes.</p>

<p>Depending on the blogs in your feed reader, or who you follow on Twitter, or just in general googling, you will probably come across references to the same group of IoC/DI containers. Chiefly:</p>

<ul>
    <li><a title="StructureMap on Github" href="http://structuremap.github.com/structuremap/index.html" target="_blank">StructureMap</a></li>
    <li><a title="Castle Windsor" href="http://www.castleproject.org/" target="_blank">Castle Windsor</a></li>
    <li><a title="AutoFac on Google code" href="http://code.google.com/p/autofac/" target="_blank">AutoFac</a></li>
    <li><a title="Ninject" href="http://ninject.org/" target="_blank">Ninject</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://www.codeplex.com/MEF/" target="_blank">MEF</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://msdn.com/unity">Unity</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://www.springframework.net/">Spring.net</a></li>
</ul>

<p>There are others, but it would seem hardly anyone uses them. Of those above, I have so far only used StructureMap and Ninject, and have really liked using both of them. I will try out the others at some point, but so far I've liked what I've seen in StructureMap and Ninject, I honestly don't think that any of the others will have anything better to offer me. Besides which, StructureMap has a built in method of using it as a plugin framework. Win.</p>

<h2>In Conclusion</h2>

<p>What can I draw from all this? I don't think that I wasted any of my time or effort in writing my own plugin framework. It was a worthwhile exercise which taught me a lot of things, and I urge you to do the same.</p>

<h1>Unless you've been living under a rock</h1>

<p>You will have seen, heard and read the buzz about the Apple <a title="ipad on Apple.com" href="http://www.apple.com/ipad/" target="_blank">iPad</a>. What it is, what it does and why you should buy it. This post is not about all that - it's covered in excruciating detail elsewhere on your favourite tech site. Ever since the iPad was just a rumour, and since it was officially announced, we have been arguing about it at work. Whose going to buy one? Who is an idiot for wanting to buy one? Who is an idiot for not wanting to buy one?</p>

<blockquote>Note: I should mention that I do happen to own an iPhone (via an O2 two year(!) contract), and I think it is probably the best mobile phone I've ever owned, however, I will take some convincing to enter into another two year contract again. But I digress. I have a couple of old iPods, nothing else: I am not a <a title="Fanboy on wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fan_%28person%29" target="_blank">fanboy</a>.</blockquote>

<p>The niche that the iPad and devices like it fill is undoubtedly there, or else these products would not be developed. The key thing here is "...and devices like it...". There isn't just the iPad to consider.ï¿½ This is the fantastic thing about our society: we have a huge freedom of choice in our purchasing decisions. We are free to evaluate, consider and weigh all the pros and cons of a particular product before we make the commitment to purchase.</p>

<h1>Unless you are an Apple fanboy</h1>

<p>In which case, you have already sub-concisiously made the decision to purchase anything with an Apple logo on. Are you an Apple fan boy? You have a Mac of some discription. You bought (and probably still have) a first-gen iPod. You bought an iTouch the day it was release. You were the first in your office to get an iPhone. You were the first to upgrade to an iPhone 3G. You were the first to upgrade to an iPhone 3GS. You hammer F5 on your favourite liveblog of an Apple event. You wouldn't even consider buying a laptop from Asus, Acer or Dell (or whoever) which as powerful and costs half the price of something which has a fucking Apple logo on it.</p>

<p>Fanboy. Acolyte. Get out. You have already made your choice. You cannot win an arguement with someone who fanatically believes they are right.</p>

<h1>Open minded? Continue from here</h1>

<p>For those who are prepared to broaden our horizons, there is a bewildering array of choice just around the corner. Rather than rehash other people's hard work from around the interweb, and because I'm lazy, I refer you to this article on About.com: <a href="http://portables.about.com/od/otherdevices/tp/Slate_tablet_roundup.htm" target="_blank">http://portables.about.com/od/otherdevices/tp/Slate<em>tablet</em>roundup.htm</a>, which offers a succinct highlight of varous slate tablet computers. <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/03/05/microsofts-courier-digital-journal-exclusive-pictures-and-de/" target="_blank">Engadget also has some details</a> of Microsofts offering, the 'Courier', which looks promising.</p>

<h1>In Conclusion</h1>

<p>You do not have to kneel at the alter of the cult of Apple. You have a choice. Use it wisely.</p>

<p><a title="Link to earlier blog post." href="http://temporalcohesion.co.uk/2008/08/29/source-control-using-dropbox/" target="_self">Some time ago</a>, I wrote about using <a title="Link to dropbox.com" href="https://www.dropbox.com/" target="_blank">Dropbox </a>as a version control system. I now realise how naiveï¿½ and short-sighted that thought was. At the time, it was my belief that a dropbox account could be suitable for maintaining version history, and after a fashion, it can be, because using the web client to view your files, you can see previous versions ofï¿½ the files in your dropbox.</p>

<p>However, there are problems with this approach. Consider that you've changed several files, but then you realise that the changes you have made are not good enough, or just don't work. With svn, or vss (<em>vomit</em>), you can undo-checkout to get the previous version back, with dropbox you can roll back to the previous version - one file at a time. There is no branching, no merging, no tagging. Nothing like a traditional SCM tool should have.</p>

<p>Dropbox is after all, essentially just a folder that is backed up "to the cloud". If we use the right tool, we can take advantage of this properly.</p>

<h1>Enter Git</h1>

<p>What is <a title="Git SCM" href="http://git-scm.com/" target="_blank">Git</a>? Well, surely you must have at least heard of Git by now? If not, I refer you to the <a title="Wikipedia article about git" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)" target="_blank">wikipedia page</a> about Git. Ok? You're back?</p>

<p>The key aspect of Git which we can take advantage of is essentially the very nature of Git itself. Every Git clone is a full-repository, containing the full commit  history and full revision tracking capability for the project, and it does not rely on network access nor a central server.</p>

<p>Basically, the idea is that you initialise an empty, bare repository inside your dropbox folder, and then somewhere else on your filesystem, perhaps a development folder where you store all your projects, you clone the repo from dropbox, and do all your work on that clone. Then when you call 'git push origin master', your changes are pushed into the dropbox repo, ready to be synced up on other computers you use.</p>

<blockquote>Note: This is not a substitue for having a proper hosted Git repository, such as a project on Github, or somewhere else. However, it useful if you are working on something you aren't ready to put into the public domain, or you haven't yet decided to purchase an account on a private repository provider.</blockquote>

<h1>Setup</h1>

<p>Setting it up is fairly simple, but, I am going to assume that you have Dropbox and a dropbox account, Git and (if you are on Windows) GitExtensions, correctly installed already.</p>

<blockquote>Note: I have only tested this on Windows 7, but I wouldn't expect it to not work on any other system. As always YMMV.</blockquote>

<p>First, create a folder in your dropbox folder to house your projects, e.g. C:UsersStuartDocumentsMy Dropboxprojects or just store it in the root of your Dropbox, it's upto you. Don't forget to include quotes around any path that has a space in, or else it won't work.</p>

<p>[sourcecode language="bash"]</p>

<p>Stuart@LAPTOP ~/Documents/My Dropbox/projects
$ mkdir example</p>

<p>Stuart@LAPTOP ~/Documents/My Dropbox/projects
$ cd example</p>

<p>Stuart@LAPTOP ~/Documents/My Dropboxprojects/example
$ mkdir .git</p>

<p>Stuart@LAPTOP ~/Documents/My Dropbox/projects/example
$ cd .git/</p>

<p>Stuart@LAPTOP ~/Documents/My Dropbox/projects/example/example.git
$ git init --bare
Initialized empty Git repository in c:/Users/Stuart/Documents/My Dropbox/projects/example
/example.git/</p>

<p>[/sourcecode]</p>

<p>Then, in your development folder clone that repo.</p>

<p>[sourcecode language="bash"]
Stuart@LAPTOP /c/development/examples
$ git clone -v &quot;C:/Users/Stuart/Documents/My Dropbox/projects/example/.git&quot;
Initialized empty Git repository in c:/development/examples/example/.git/</p>

<h4>Update:</h4>

<p>I've written some more about what I've learned whilst working on my plugin manager here: <a href="http://temporalcohesion.co.uk/2010/03/17/even-more-on-the-generic-plugin-manager/" target="_self">http://temporalcohesion.co.uk/2010/03/17/even-more-on-the-generic-plugin-manager/</a></p>

<p>A few months ago <a title="Writing a generic plugin manager" href="http://temporalcohesion.co.uk/2009/05/25/writing-a-generic-plugin-manager-in-c/" target="_self">I wrote about</a> writing a generic plugin loader/manager in C#, where I offered links to several articles and referenced a rather excellent book about C# which I had used to base my plugin loader on. I hadn't really given it much thought since then, but according to Google Analytic's, it's one of the most hit posts on my blog. Recently I had a request to release the source code.</p>

<p>Now when I first wrote that post, I was hesitant to include any code, and I still am - not because I think there is something new and unique with what I've done - but, rather that what I have written is not terribly difficult to write. I do not mean to sound snobbish or arrogant at all, I'm just telling you how it is, all I've done is to do a bit of reflection on assemblies in a folder, and load instances of certain interfaces.</p>

<p>Anyway...</p>

<p>The scenario is that you want to provide a way for for 3rd parties to be able to add additional functionality to your application at run time. We need to provide a common way for 3rd parties to be able to register their new functionality into our application, in order that the user can take advantage of the exciting new feature being added to the application.</p>

<p>Straight away, you should be thinking to yourself: Interface!</p>

<pre class="lang:csharp decode:1 " >

public interface IPlugin
 {
 /// &amp;lt;summary&amp;gt;
 /// Does what ever It is.
 /// &amp;lt;/summary&amp;gt;
 void Do(Action it);
 }

</pre>

<p>Anyone who now wants to create a plugin for our application must implement our IPlugin interface, as it defines the contract to which our application is bound to, in order to recognise and load plugins. Thus any assembly, that has a class which implements IPlugin is considered by our application to be a plugin which is capable of offering additional functionality.</p>

<p>We can now attempt to load our plugins. We need to have a class which can scan a folder for assemblies, scan those assemblies for types which implement IPlugin, and then create instances of them which our application can use. Loading the assemblies is easy:</p>

<pre class="lang:csharp decode:1 " >
public class PluginLoader&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;
{
 private IList&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; pluginsList = new List&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;();
 ...
}

...

public virtual IList&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; LoadPlugins()
 {
 foreach (string file in Directory.GetFiles(this.pluginFolderPath, &amp;quot;*.dll&amp;quot;, SearchOption.AllDirectories))
 {
 Assembly assembly = Assembly.LoadFile(file);
 this.LoadObjects(assembly);
 }

 return this.pluginsList;
 }
</pre>

<p>We create a generic class, so we can use it with any type of plugin, and not just ones which implement IPlugin, then it's just simple directory recursion to load all the files in the specified folder which have a file extension of .dll. The real magic happens in the LoadObjects() method.</p>

<pre class="lang:csharp decode:1 " >
var types = from t in assembly.GetTypes()
 where t.IsClass &amp;amp;&amp;amp;
 (t.GetInterface(typeof(T).Name) != null)
 select t;

 foreach (Type t in types)
 {
 T plugin = (T)assembly.CreateInstance(t.FullName, true);
 this.pluginsList.Add(plugin);
 }
</pre>

<p>Using LINQ, we extract all the types from the assembly which are classes, which implement the interface which is a typeof(T) - T being the type we specified when we instantiated the class. You could just as easily here specify the type should inherit from some other type, and you could also check to see if a class has some assembly level attribute.</p>

<p>Why would you want to do that? Well, we can use an assembly level attribute to decorate the plugin class with meta-data about the plugin, such as the author, a short description, the name of the plugin, and it's version.</p>

<pre class="lang:csharp decode:1 " >
public virtual KeyValuePair&amp;lt;string, List&amp;lt;KeyValuePair&amp;lt;string, string&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; GetPluginInformation(Type type)
 {
 var attributeInfo = from pa in type.GetCustomAttributes(false)
 where (pa.GetType() == typeof(PluginAttribute))
 select pa;

 foreach (PluginAttribute p in attributeInfo)
 {
 data.Add(new KeyValuePair&amp;lt;string, string&amp;gt;(&amp;quot;Author&amp;quot;, p.Author));
 data.Add(new KeyValuePair&amp;lt;string, string&amp;gt;(&amp;quot;Description&amp;quot;, p.Description));
 data.Add(new KeyValuePair&amp;lt;string, string&amp;gt;(&amp;quot;Name&amp;quot;, p.Name));
 name = p.Name;
 data.Add(new KeyValuePair&amp;lt;string, string&amp;gt;(&amp;quot;Type&amp;quot;, p.Type.ToString()));
 data.Add(new KeyValuePair&amp;lt;string, string&amp;gt;(&amp;quot;Version&amp;quot;, p.Version));
 }

 this.attributeInformation = new KeyValuePair&amp;lt;string, List&amp;lt;KeyValuePair&amp;lt;string, string&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;(name, data);

 return this.attributeInformation;
 }
</pre>

<p>Or you could create a struct to use as a DTO for the plugin meta-data, it's up to you.</p>

<p>I've removed all the comments and exception handling from the code I've posted purely just to save space, you'd really want to include that - especially the exception handling. But that's really all there is to it, you might want to have a property to access the actual plugin list, or return it from a LoadPlugins method, it's up to you.</p>

<p>You'll notice I've made the methods virtual, you may want to use this class as a base class in another class. For instance I've got an additional class which inherits from my plugin loader class which does specific tasks for a particular type of plugin, and another which does different tasks for a different type of plugin.</p>
