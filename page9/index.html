<p>Love him or hate him, several years ago, Jeff Atwood (of Codinghorror.com infamy and the really rather awesome StackOverflow.com) <a title="Recommended reading on codinghorror.com" href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000020.html" target="_blank">posted on his blog</a> a recommended reading list for developers. He has since become a sort of mini internet programming celebrity. Since imitation is the greatest form of flattery, I present to you my own list of recommended reading.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"></p>

<p>[caption id="attachment_100" align="alignleft" width="131" caption="Code Complete 2nd Edition"]<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0735619670?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tempocohes-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=0735619670"><img class="size-full wp-image-100 " title="Code Complete 2nd Edition" src="http://temporalcohesion.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/51seLiYuURL._SL160_.jpg" alt="Code Complete 2nd Edition" width="131" height="160" /></a>[/caption]</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Code Complete 2nd Edition</strong>, by <a title="SteveMcConnell.com" href="http://www.stevemcconnell.com/" target="_blank">Steve McConnel</a> should be recommended reading on software engineering degrees at Universities the world over. It is a classic book about the software industry. McConnel makes the distinction between average programmers, who are happy to go through the motions of churning out (usually terrible) code and collecting their wages; and above average programmers, who continually seek to improve their base knowledge, actively improving their skills, who write solid, well designed and easily maintainable code. I think this was the book that really changed my mindset about being a programmer, about being proud of the work I do and the programs I write and maintain.</p>

<p>[caption id="attachment_103" align="alignright" width="121" caption="Working Effectively with Legacy Code"]<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0131177052?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tempocohes-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=0131177052"><img class="size-full wp-image-103  " title="Working Effectively with Legacy Code" src="http://temporalcohesion.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/51TG9F1B8AL._SL160_.jpg" alt="Working Effectively with Legacy Code" width="121" height="160" /></a>[/caption]</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Working Effectively with Legacy Code</strong>, by <a title="MichaelFeathers.com" href="http://www.michaelfeathers.com/" target="_blank">Michael Feathers</a> is another classic book, and another which I believe should be recommended reading on all University software engineering degrees. The reason I would recommended this book to any aspiring developer is that, more than likely they are going to be working with legacy code. I would say that 95% of the code I work with on a daily basis is legacy code, although that figure is slowly improving, thanks in a large part to the skills and knowledge I've gained from this book.� Feathers' defines legacy code as that which does not have unit tests. I would also add that most legacy code is often poorly designed, with no comments and is usually incredibly difficult to maintain. The book is split into three parts, the first part being about how you can bring about change in your legacy code base (and legacy developers!); the second part is like an FAQ, which links techniques together in a way to address common problems; the third part is a reference of the different dependency breaking techniques that can be employed to get your legacy code under test and under control.</p>

<p>[caption id="attachment_104" align="alignleft" width="128" caption="The Art of Unit Testing"]<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1933988274?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tempocohes-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=1933988274"><img class="size-full wp-image-104  " title="The Art of Unit Testing" src="http://temporalcohesion.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/51PwNFas0pL._SL160_.jpg" alt="The Art of Unit Testing" width="128" height="160" /></a>[/caption]</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>The Art of Unit Testing</strong>, by <a title="ISerializable - Roy Osherove's Blog" href="http://weblogs.asp.net/ROsherove/" target="_blank">Roy Osherove</a>, is an excellent book, full of practical advice about unit testing. The book covers everything, from why you want to unit test your code, to how you can unit test code. Even if, as I had, you have written unit tests before, then you can still learn something from this book. Indeed there were several patterns on how to approach particular problems that I'd not even considered before. Also, I had never really gotten my head around using a mock object framework as part of my unit tests, but this book explains and demonstrates in a clear and concise manner, exactly how you can leverage your mock object framework of choice for your benefit. One minor criticism that I have though, is that I feel there is a certain element of bias toward <a title="Typemock Isolator, mock object framework" href="http://learn.typemock.com/" target="_blank">Typemock Isolator</a> - Osherove is a chief architect at Typemock.</p>

<p><strong>Holub on Patterns</strong>, by <a title="Holub.com" href="http://www.holub.com/" target="_blank">Allen Holub</a>, is another excellent book, about software design.� Design patterns offer an excellent way of not re-inventing the wheel, and Holub offers an entertaining and insightful tour of the majority of the <a title="The Famous Gang of Four book" href="href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0201633612?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tempocohes-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=0201633612&quot;" target="_blank">Gang of Four</a> patterns, and offers real world scenarios in which you would use them. The book is very opinionated, but this is not a bad thing, indeed it is refreshing to read as Holub is obviously very passionate about the subject. It certainly opened my eyes into the world of design patterns, as I'm one of these who finds concrete, interesting examples an excellent tool for learning, and I've always found the Gang of Four book rather dry.</p>

<p><strong>C# In Depth</strong>, by <a title="Jon Skeet's Coding Blog" href="http://msmvps.com/blogs/jon_skeet/default.aspx" target="_blank">Jon Skeet</a> is an excellent book about the C# programming language. If you want to understand something about C#, and I mean really, truly understand why the language does what it does, then I suggest that you read this book. The book is clear and straightforward, with excellent examples. Honestly if most of the people posting C# questions on stackoverflow.com read this book, then I suspect the number of questions would stop increasing at the current rate.</p>

<p>Like many people, I have a vanity domain name, www.stuart-grassie.co.uk. Many moons ago I used to host my blog on there, but for a variety of reasons I bought this domain and switched my blog here. So I put up a basic index page, listing a few interesting factoids about me, and what I do. When I say a "basic" page, I mean basic - black text on a white background, almost as if it was just few words typed into a text file - although there was semantically correct and valid xhtml behind it.</p>

<p>The other day I came across a link,<a title="30 Examples of Extreme Minimalism in web design" href="http://singlefunction.com/30-examples-of-extreme-minimalism-in-web-design/" target="_blank"> 30 Examples of Extreme Minimalism in web design</a> and it inspired me to do a small make-over on my vanity domain name site. Which I think has turned out fairly ok. Athough that isn't the point of this blog post.</p>

<p>As there is not a massive amount of information (after all it's just a "here I am, here's some information about me, here's how you can contact me" site, all of it is on one page. I'm using jQuery to hide everything, until the user clicks a link to see the information they want. I used jQuery UI, to use a couple of basic slide in/out effects. The actual effects are "clip" and "blind", using "toggle" to turn them on/off. All the other content apart from the "frontpage" is hidden.</p>

<p>Initially, I had it working so that you could click a link, and the requested "page" would transition into view, the "frontpage" would transition out of view, then I had a &lt;span&gt;&lt;back&lt;/span&gt;, which I made react to mouse clicks, using jQuery, and you could then click back to the "frontpage".</p>

<pre lang="html">
<div id="main">
Maybe you would like to read this <a id="examplelink" href="#example">example</a> page.</div>
<div id="example">

This is some example content.</div></pre>

<pre lang="javascript">$(document).ready(function(){
    $("#example").hide(); // Hide the example on page load
});

// detect when the link is clicked, and toggle the two<div>'s
$(function() {
    $("#examplelink").click(function() {
    $("#example").toggle("clip", {}, 500);
        $("#main").toggle("blind", {}, 500);
    return false;
    });
});</pre>

<p>In my excitement to get this learned and done (I've never used jQuery before), I've lost the original code, but that's essentially what I had, without the code to detect when the fake back button <span>back</span> is clicked - all it did was to run the toggle again, which returned the user to the "frontpage". I had to to do it this way, because the browser forward/back doesn't work.</p>

<p>Clearly, this is not an ideal situation, because it has broken one of the cardinal web design guidelines, by breaking the users browser, by rendering the forward/back buttons inoperable.</p>

<p>I'll show you what I did next time.</p>

		<a href="/2009/07/25/adding-logging-to-an-application/">Adding logging to an application</a> <small>Saturday, 25 Jul, 2009</small>

	   </ul>
   </div>
            
   
   
<p>Nearly every application I have ever used has produced some sort of log output, usually to record details of exactly what the application was doing when an error was encountered. To be perfectly truthful, it is not something that I have ever really given very much consideration to in either my own or work applications, there have always been more pressing things to attend to, such as meeting (unrealistic) deadlines, or implementing some interesting new feature. I've used log4j before in a work application, mostly because someone else had already done all the configuration.</p>

<p>However, the application that is currently occupying the main focus of my attention at work had (almost) no logging in it what-s0-ever, but given the nature of the application, it can be very difficult to debug exactly what is happening internally using breakpoints. Again, the nature of the application doesn't really lend itself well to showing MessageBox's all the over the place.</p>

<pre lang="csharp">MessageBox.Show("Log message");

// or..

Console.WriteLine("Log message");</pre>

<p>How many times have you done that, or the equivalent, in an application? If you are like me, then you'll have done it hundreds of times, probably in the same application. It's really quick and easy to do, and can be very useful. You just have to remember to take it out of the Release build. What a pain.</p>

<p><strong>A better way</strong></p>

<p>Using a proper logging library (as I have now discovered) allows you much greater freedom. Freedom to not have to (overly) worry about leaving in <em>Log.Debug("Some message")</em> all over the code. Freedom to be able to configure what is logged, where it is logged to and how it is displayed. Freedom to receive concrete data on how your application is behaving in the real world, which will enable you to find and fix bugs faster than you would have thought possible.</p>

<p>There are a multitude of logging libraries available:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Write your own</li>
    <li>System.Diagnostics.Trace and System.Diagnostics.Debug</li>
    <li>The Logging Application block from the <a title="Microsoft Enterprise Library" href="http://www.codeplex.com/entlib" target="_self">Enterprise Library</a></li>
    <li>Bitfactory.Logging from <a title="Bitfactory.Logging from theobjectguy" href="http://www.theobjectguy.com/dotnetlog/" target="_blank">http://www.theobjectguy.com/dotnetlog/</a></li>
    <li><a title="NLog C# logging library" href="http://csharp-source.net/open-source/logging/nlog" target="_blank">NLog</a></li>
    <li> Plus many more that you can find via google or on Stack Overflow.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, while it would probably be an interesting exercise to write a small logging library, the world doesn't need another one, so I immediately discounted that option.</p>

<p>I've used System.Diagnostics here and there, and an ex-colleague wrote a small logging library based around using Trace and Debug, but that is getting dangerously close to writing your own logging library, so again that's out.</p>

<p>The Logging application block from the Enterprise Library just seems too weighty, and too much of a pain to configure (I can probably be proved wrong though), so I discounted that as well.</p>

<p>The object guy's logging library seems pretty good, but the documentation and examples kind of suck, and it doesn't look like it's been updated in a while, so after playing with it a little bit (and not really liking it all that much to be perfectly honest), I discounted that as well, although it does seem to have a lot of fans on Stack Overflow.</p>

<p>NLog has plenty of documentation, and seems pretty straightforward to use, and it too has a lot of fans on Stack Overflow, but again, it's not been updated in a while, so I discounted that too.</p>

<p><strong>Log4Net to the rescue</strong></p>

<p>Log4Net is part of the <a title="Apache Logging Services" href="http://logging.apache.org/" target="_self">Apache Logging Services</a> project, along with Log4j, and Log4Cxx. It is a C# port of Log4j, and works amazingly well. I am not going to write about how to set it up and configure it, as <a title="log4net info on beefycode.com" href="http://www.beefycode.com/category/log4net.aspx">others have done that already</a>, and the documentation is excellent.</p>

<p>I've read here and there on some blogs, a few message boards and some email lists, that log4net is difficult and time consuming to set-up, and that it is hard to use. Which is nonsense, because after ten minutes (which included downloading the latest version) I had my first small test application up and running and outputting debug messages to the Output window in Visual Studio. Pretty swish indeed.� I did spend some time reading about the best ways to use log4net, and I still do, but I didn't find the initial set-up to be inordinately difficult at all.</p>

<p>On the whole, I am impressed with it's ease of use, I'm now starting to use it in my own personal projects, and it is proving to be invaluable at work.</p>

<h4>Update:</h4>

<p>I have written another post on this subject with some code examples  here: <a title="More on the generic plugin manager" href="http://temporalcohesion.co.uk/2009/11/02/more-on-the-generic-plugin-manager/" target="_self">http://temporalcohesion.co.uk/2009/11/02/more-on-the-generic-plugin-manager/</a></p>

<h4>Update 2:</h4>

<p>There is another follow on post here: <a href="http://temporalcohesion.co.uk/2010/03/17/even-more-on-the-generic-plugin-manager/">http://temporalcohesion.co.uk/2010/03/17/even-more-on-the-generic-plugin-manager/</a> where I talk about what I've learned.</p>

<p>One of my current long term hobby project is a  map/world editor that I'm writing for Andy's (work in progress) game engine. It is still in a quite rudimentary stage, however, I have gotten an important aspect of the application into a fairly mature state already, and that is the plugin system.</p>

<p>I don't want to get into too much detail over things that are available via some simple searches on google, so don't expect too much code. There are some good articles <a title="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms972962.aspx" href="http://" target="_blank">here</a>, <a title="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/macros/PluginsManager.aspx?display=Print" href="http://" target="_blank">here </a>and <a title="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/cs/Plugin_Basics.aspx" href="http://" target="_blank">here</a>, which delve quite deeply into this, and how to develop a plugin framework in general. I developed my plugin framework based on the code in <a title="http://www.amazon.com/2008-NET-Platform-Fourth-Windows-Net/dp/1590598849" href="http://" target="_blank">this book</a>, which incidentally is a very good book.</p>

<p>Also, in my own google searches on this subject, a lot of the articles I found are getting to be four years old, in a few instances even older. Not that this automatically makes them invalid as sources of information, it's just that they may not reflect best practices in modern C#. (Not that I am claiming to be a <a title="http://msmvps.com/blogs/jon_skeet/default.aspx" href="http://" target="_blank">Jon Skeet</a>-like C# guru). Also, quite a few of the ones I found make use of an XML configuration file to hold a reference to the plugins. I'm not a big fan of this type of thing, I much prefer convention over configuration.</p>

<p><strong>Why Generic?</strong></p>

<p>I've written a plugin system for the Editor because I want to provide a way to make it easily extendible in the future, without having to change the core application, to enable it to perform actions that are above and beyond it's core capabilities. Byond that basic requirement, there are a couple of other reasons to make it a generic plugin framework.</p>

<p>Firstly, I've made it generic because I wanted to make a distinction between different types of plugins, such as a type of plugin for resources, and a type of plugin which adds functionality into the application (such as tools, UI widgets etc).</p>

<p>Secondly, and perhaps most important (to me, anyway), is that I'll never need to write a C# plugin framework again, for any of my personal projects. I've had a go at writing a plugin framework before, a few times for none-work projects and once for a project at work, and I finally realised what my problem was - reinventing the wheel each time.</p>

<p>The plugin framework I've written ensures that I don't have to worry about this the next time one of my pet projects needs a plugin system. The Editor will in fact have two types of plugins available, one to extend the types of data sources it can load in resources from, and another to provide additional functionality, like tools.</p>

<p>I'm fairly pleased with the way that it has turned out, and it works quite well in practice.</p>

<p>Firstly, I haven't really shown how I use the Problem interface. You can see it in part 1 of this series of posts. In Eclipse, you can create a new class in a package, which should bring up the "New Java Class" dialog. Give the class a name - for Project Euler problems I've chosen to name them "One", "Two", "Three" etc. You can then add an interface that the class is to implement, click 'Add', and type in Problem. You can also choose some methods to stub out, tick 'public static void main(String[] args)'. Click Ok, and you should get something like this:</p>

<pre lang="java">package co.uk.temporalcohesion.euler.problems;

import co.uk.temporalcohesion.euler.interfaces.Problem;

public class One implements Problem {

    public String answer() {
        // TODO Auto-generated method stub
        return null;
    }

    public int id() {
        // TODO Auto-generated method stub
        return 0;
    }

    public double time() {
        // TODO Auto-generated method stub
        return 0;
    }

    /**
     * @param args
     */
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // TODO Auto-generated method stub

    }

}</pre>

<p>I can hear you asking why am I including then main(String[] args) function if we already have a class that is capable of running the problems (the main Euler class)? Well, what I do to create is to create a Euler object in the problems main method, and get it to run the problem, like this:</p>

<pre lang="java">        /**
     * @param args
     */
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new Euler().run(1, true);
    }</pre>

<p>So the problem class is running itself using the Euler object, which knows how to find the problem, instantiate it and run it. I find doing things this way is easier when working on the problem, as you can simply run the problem as a java application, and it will output the result in a standard format we are expecting to to the console in Eclipse.</p>

<p>Thinking about it, you might be wondering - what's the point of all this, it seems a little excessive for something that can be done fairly easily? Well - I've done it like this because the whole point of me doing the problems on Project Euler, is to practice problem solving and become more comfortable in my use of Java. So I think what I've done is pretty valid in that regard.</p>
