<p>The other day, I watched the Linus Torvalds <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XpnKHJAok8" title="Linus Torvald's tech talk on git" target="_blank">tech talk</a> at google, which he gave on source control systems. It was mostly (biased) about how great <a href="http://git.or.cz/" target="_blank">git</a> is, and how other source control systems, with a few exceptions, have mostly got it wrong. This all got me thinking about source control systems I have used.</p>

<p>Now, I use Microsoft's <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/aa718670.aspx" target="_blank">Visual Sourcesafe</a> every day at work, and let me tell you: it's shit. The only (slightly) good thing about it, is the integration with VS.Net 2005, which is unsurprisingly very good. I know that I'm not really offering much of an argument as to exactly why VSS is a horrible pile of dog turd, but anyone whose ever used will understand.</p>

<p>Anyway. I digress.</p>

<p>I never really thought that the creator of Linux would be such an engaging and humorous speaker - aren't stereotypes fun - but he was. It kind of got me thinking about source control. I've used CVS and SVN before on a few open source projects I've contributed to, or just wanted to get the latest source for.</p>

<p>I've mostly only ever used CVS or SVN, arguably the two most popular version control systems currently in use today. Better than VSS in every way, but still lacking quite a lot. For instance it's a well known fact that merges in CVS are a horrible nightmare, and that merges in SVN aren't much better. Thankfully I've never had to do them. And I know enough about VSS to know that merges are just generally avoided. Like you'd try to avoid an STI.</p>

<p>So, over the weekend (you'll notice how much of my free time is "over the weekend") I decided to have a little play with with some distributed version control systems. Now, I'm not going to go on about what one of those is, nor how great they are, as you can use google for that. But suffice to say that they are fucking ace.</p>

<p>I had to discount Git pretty much straight away - for various reasons (development being primary) I've installed Winxp back onto my laptop, and I'm playing with Windows Server 2003 R2 on my dev server, so I road tested Mercurial and Bazaar-ng. I spent a great deal of time researching the two systems, and ultimately decided to go with bazaar.  I've not really got down to much development with bazaar yet, but early results look promising.</p>

<p>After about 10 minutes fannying around, I had Bazaar installed, and a shared repository set-up on my dev server, which I checked out and branched a few times on my laptop (3 branches: dev, testing and stable). With bazaar I can make as many dev branches as I like, for each crazy idea I have, and easily merge them upstream as they become awesomely realised ideas, or deleted and forgotten about like a red-headed step-child.</p>

<p>This is all on my laptop, and I can easily push my working code onto my desktop if I want to code on there, or back onto my server for safe keeping, or publish it on a website. Or any combination of those. I'll post some more about Bazaar after I've been using it for a while.</p>

<p>I spent much of the weekend fucking around installing linux on my laptop. I like linux, it's free, and there's loads of cool software available. I tried:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Ubuntu 7.04</li>
    <li>Fedora 7</li>
    <li>opensuse 10.2</li>
</ul>

<p>The actual installations themselves went pretty painlessly, just pop the disk in, and boot from it, and click install. These modern installations are pretty cool, not like the good old days of installing redhat/slackware/debian from multiple floppy discs.</p>

<p>The only problem I had was getting my 3Com 3crwe62092b wireless lan pcmcia card to work. What a pain in the fucking arse that was. Ubuntu Feistey Fawn 7.04 wouldn't even detect it, and Fedora 7 detected it, but it wouldn't work.</p>

<p>Needless to say, I was getting frustrated at this point, and I downloaded opensuse 10.2, specifically a 44mb network install disk. And fuck me, it asked me for wlan details, and connected to my wireless network first time. Ace.</p>

<p>But - and theres always a but - when it rebooted there was a problem. The wireless stopped working. I managed to get the rest of the installation completed using a wired connection. After some further googling, it turns out that the solution to my problem was to download the atmel-firmware, and copy the *.bin's to /lib/firmware. Rebooted and the wireless came up straightway. Hurrah!</p>

<p>I suspect that armed with this new knowledge I should be able to install Ubuntu/Fedora and get the card to work on them, but I'm liking opensuse enough that I'm not sure I can be bothered to reinstall a different distribution again.</p>

<p>This is also the reason that linux isn't ready for the desktop yet - the average person wouldn't spend time googling and recompiling kernels and installing different distributions just to get wireless working on their laptop. It should just work, with no effort. This is the advantage that windows has over linux, the driver support is significantly better.</p>

<p>But it works for me, so fuck em.</p>

   <h1 class="title"><a href="/2007/07/23/limitations-in-delphi/">Limitations in Delphi</a></h1>
   <div class="meta">Monday, 23 Jul, 2007
   </div>
            
   
   
<p>One of the things in Delphi that frustrates me is the inability to match on strings in case statements. For those people who haven't done delphi before, case statements are very similar to c++ switch statements, and only opererate on ordinal types.. Now I've not done any Java, but as I understand it you can't switch on strings in that language either. You can in c# though.</p>

<p>I think C# is generally better, but that said I have it on good authority that templates are still much better in C++ than generics are in C#.</p>

<p>Anyway, that's enough rambling. On to the solution.</p>

<p>What you need to do in order to get around this limitation is cheat. Well, it's not really cheating. The tricks is to use a look up function that accepts a string, one that you are expecting, which you have in a string array. Then all you need do is return which element of the array has been matched, and use that in the case statement.</p>

<pre lang="delphi">
function TClassName.lookupFunction(lookup: string): integer;
const
  ARRAY = ['one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five'];
var
  i: integer;
begin
  for i := 0 to Length(ARRAY) do
    if lookup = ARRAY[i] then
    begin
      Result := i;
      break;
    end
end

procedure TClassName.someProc(somestring: string);
begin
  case LookupFunction(somestring)
  1 : //code that does stuff for 'one'
  2 : //code that does stuff for 'two'
  3 : //code that does stuff for 'three'
  4 : //code that does stuff for 'four'
  5 : //code that does stuff for 'five'
end</pre>

<p>See! That's how simple it is.</p>

<p>Maybe in a future version of delphi borland/codegear will introduce native string support for case statements. I won't hold my breather though.</p>

<p>Welcome to my new website, and my new blog. I'd kind of outgrown the old site, which I've now turned into a kind of "here's my CV" sort of site. Although I am happy in my job.</p>

<p>I'm going to attempt to write more often on here, about a lot of things. I'm still getting things just the way I like them - I've still got a few plugins for wordpress to download and install yet. If I get time I might even write my own theme, but considering there are so many already brilliant themes available I might just save myself the time and effort.</p>

<p>Hell, that's why I'm using Wordpress and not writing my own blogging system.</p>

<p>As an old friend of mine used to say: Onwards and Upwards!</p>
